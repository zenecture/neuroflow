from cscsbrownedu hokchung tsangsubject re saturns pricing policyin article cvirlrshuksandsboeingcom freddshuksan fred dickey writes carolinafanuiuc ckauxacsouiucedu wrote i have been active in defending saturn lately on the net and would like to state my full opinion on the subject rather than just reply to others points the biggest problem some people seem to be having is that saturn dealers make k on a car i think most will agree with me that the car is comparably priced with its competitors that is they arent overpriced compared to most cars in their class i dont understand the point of arguing over whether the dealer makes the k or not i have never understood what the big deal over dealer profits is either the only thing that i can figure out is that people believe that if they minimize the dealer profit they will minimize their total outofpocket expenses for the car while this may be true in some cases i do not believe that it is generally true i bought a saturn sl in january of at that time based on studying car prices i decided that there was no comparable car that was priced as cheaply as the saturn sure maybe i could have talked the price for some other car to the saturn price but my outofpocket expenses wouldnt have been any different whats important to me is how much money i have left after i buy the car reducing dealer profit is not the same thing as saving money show me how reducing dealer profit saves me money and ill believe that its important my experience has been that reducing dealer profit does not necessarily save me money fredsay you bought your saturn at k with a dealer profit of kif the dealer profit is then you would only be paying k forthe same car so isnt that saving moneymoreover if saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by then their cars will be even better deals say if the price of a saturn wasalready below market average for the class of cars then after theyreduce the dealer profit it would be below market average it will attract even more people to buy saturns because it would save them money force the competitors to lower their prices to survivenow not only will saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit even the buyers for other cars will pay lessisnt that saving moneydougfrom tedebearlelandstanfordedu theodore chensubject re are bmws worth the price in article aprwdlloralcom

that something is there i wont argue too much about anything i am probably one of those that think that we cant have enough safety on the roads i would gladly sacrifice distractions as you call it than someone having trouble seeingdanger earlier one saved life justifies more than my lifetime of distractionsfor me and then there is dawn and dusk when your eyes have not yet adjusted to the poor light and there are those who drive blackgrey cars and then there is the case where you are driving down a twoway one lane road and someone is overtaking cars and coming the opposite direction doesnt see you because your lights are not on or vice versa at mph that is quite a small reaction time but of course we are too macho to think we are invincible and can react faster than that only the poor sod who you didnt see might not have a normal life everi worked out the reaction time in a previous post and its plenty even foran year old grandma as long as speeds are in the mph range or lessif you or some other driver is going way faster than that then be carefulas always you are responsible for your driving actions if you pull out topass and crash into someone for whatever reason its your fault if you cant problem is that i may just kill the guy i agree that i would be at faultand i will have my license revoked why i might even go to the gas chamberbut the fact still remains that the guy is dead someone died because iwas too stingy to put on my lights see a damn thing then you shouldnt be driving lights fail fallen treesor rocks dont have lights etc i maintain that headlight

are too stupid to do soif you crash into one of those idiots you have to fight it out in court toshow his neglegence if you can even prove it just out of curiosity how much gasmilage do you loose when you put your lights on and how much do you reduce the life of your headlamps and what is the cost of your headlamps anywaymileage is certainly reduced but by a very very small amount probablyabout watts for head and running lights this is an extra horsepowerthat must be made by the engine it may be that this will cost you around two gallons a year but times million cars thats a lot of gas

that saturn dealers make k on a car i think most will agree with me that the car is comparably priced with its competitors that is they arent overpriced compared to most cars in their class i dont understand the point of arguing over whether the dealer makes the k or not i have never understood what the big deal over dealer profits is either the only thing that i can figure out is that people believe that if they minimize the dealer profit they will minimize their total outofpocket expenses for the car while this may be true in some cases i do not believe that it is generally true i bought a saturn sl in january of at that time based on studying car prices i decided that there was no comparable car that was priced as cheaply as the saturn sure maybe i could have talked the price for some other car to the saturn price but my outofpocket expenses wouldnt have been any different whats important to me is how much money i have left after i buy the car reducing dealer profit is not the same thing as saving money show me how reducing dealer profit saves me money and ill believe that its important my experience has been that reducing dealer profit does not necessarily save me money fredsay you bought your saturn at k with a dealer profit of kif the dealer profit is then you would only be paying k forthe same car so isnt that saving moneyyes but the point is that prices are competetive saturn maywell be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a profit but since a comperable honda with profit is more expensive it may be wellworth it to buy the saturnmoreover if saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by then their cars will be even better deals say if the price of a saturn wasalready below market average for the class of cars then after theyreduce the dealer profit it would be below market average it will attract even more people to buy saturns because it would save them money force the competitors to lower their prices to survivenow not only will saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit even the buyers for other cars will pay lessnot necessarily it seems to me that saturn salesdroids who dont make a commision whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generallydo make more per hour or whatever this means that saturn doesnt give upthe profit to their employees through commision which is taken out of percar profits they just pass it along to less pressureing salesmenwomenisnt that saving moneymaybe maybe not depends on accounting practices id rather paymore for dealer service that doesnt cut corners to contain costsdougcka

frequentlyin article viewlogiccom bradbuckviewlogiccom bradford kellogg writesin article marcabotballtowncmacom weltycabotballtowncmacom richard welty writes q what is ka band radar where is it used should a radar detector be able to handle it a ka band has recently been made available by the fcc for use in the us in socalled photoradar installations in these installations a lowpowered beam is aimed across the road at a degree angle to the direction of traffic and a picture is taken of vehicles which the radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle because of the low power and the degree angle many people believe that a radar detector cannot give reasonable warning of a ka band radar unit although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such capability anyway the number of locales where photoradar is in use is limited and some question the legality of such units best advice learn what photo radar units look like and keep track of where they are used or else dont speedphoto radar and mailed tickets make no sense at all speeding is a moving violation committed by the operator not the owner the owner may be a rental agency a dealer a private party or a government agency as longas the owner has no reason to expect the operator will be driving illegallyor unsafely the owner cannot be held responsible for what the operator doesthe car may even have been driven without the owners knowledge or consent i cant believe a mailed ticket where the driver is not identified would stand up in court this is obviously a lazy cynical boneheaded fascist way to extort revenue and has nothing to do with public safety bkwe had those fg photoradar things here in sweden a while agothere was a lot of fuzz about them and a lot of sabotage too a spraycanwith touchup paint can do a lot of goodeventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of courtcaseswhere the owner of the car could prove he didnt drive it at the timeof speedingi especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a carthief thathad stolen a car and made false plates he ofcourse chose a license numberof a

esp on snow however when she took it to a local subaru dealer for a oil change the bill came out to be about dollars the dealer told us it is because to change the oil filter on a svx it is necessary to disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour at first we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in toronto but found out the they are charging roughly the same price so is there any svx owner out there that has the same problem and if the oil change story is true then the engineer of subaru looks pretty stubid to me by the way the car looks great

bucks it seems to use the vehicles vacuum system instead of an electric servormotor is this good or bad if i did buythis cc which vacuum hose should i tapit has two speed sensors one magnetic and one that gets a signal from the negative side of the distributor kinda like a tach pickup or so iunderstand i can use either one which is best the manual says i readit in the store today that the magneticaxle setup is more accurate butharder to install is there really a big differenceit has a sensor for the brake pedal just like other ccs but does not have asensor for the clutch pedal so if i wasnt paying real close attention imight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up whichwould wind the engine up kinda high until i got my wits about me and turned the thing off im pretty coordinated so this doesnt bother me if itwere for my girlfriends car then it would bother me but im ok with itthe installation also calls for an attachment to a steadyon brake signaland a switchedon brake signal i think i can get a switched brake signalfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse am i right but imnot sure where to get the steadyon brake signal or for that

picked out the vehicle i wanted and after a little haggling we agreed on a price i wrote them a check for the down payment plus taxand license and told them id be back that evening to pick up the truck when i returned i had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could get to me when i finally got in there everything went smoothly until he started adding up the numbers he then discovered that they had miscalculated the tax license by about he then said he needed another from me i said we had already agreed on a price and it was their problem i wasnt giving them any more money the finance guy then brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time i reminded him that i was the customer and i didnt think i should be treated like that and that if he didnt back off he could forget the whole deal he made some smart remark so i told him where he could stick it snatched back my check and left needless to say they were not pleased by the turn of eventsearly the next morning i got a call from the general sales manager wanting to know what happened i related the story and he apologised profusely and asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind i told him that if they gave me the truck for free i probably still wouldnt take it that there were other dealers in town i was a repeat customer of theirs and that they should learn how to treat customersetcetci was still pretty steamed about the whole affair he gave me the line about hating to lose a customer and they would try to find a solution etc etc i told him not to bother thanks id go somewhere elsea couple hours later the owner of the dealership called me all apologetic etc etc etc and said that they would cover the plus knock another off the price of the truck i told him id think about it and he gave me his private direct phone number his secretarys name and assured me that they valued me as a customer etc etc etci thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we decided what the hellthat was a pretty decent deal so i called him back and accepted his offer when i went back the next day to pick up the truck i received the royal treatment everyone seemed to know about the incident even the lot boy everything went smoothly and i was out of there in my new truck in about minsso i guess im a reasonably satisfied customer however it should not have happened in the first place i was a bit shocked to have a sales person talk to me like that i dont expect them to bow and grovel but i sure dont expect to be given a hard time either esp when its

and so is not crosspostedto miscconsumers rpw changes as of april revised brake fluid section as nonsilicone dot fluids are now apparently available rpw commonly asked automotive questionstire questionsq what do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires meana typically you will see something like hr the is the overall width of the tire in millimeters the tread is usually narrower the is the aspect ratio it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width our example tire has a sidewall height of mm the is the wheel diameter in inches there are also some special tires called trx tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations like which is in millimeters the r means radial and the h is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load may safely operate common speed ratings are s mph t mph h mph and v up to mph recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation you may therefore find designations like r h the indicates the pertire load associated with the speed rating exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice what follows is a table showing a number of load indices and corresponding maximum pertire loads load index max load kg note that the usual mass vs weight confusion occurs in this table in some cases the letters p or lt may be found in front of a tire size the lt designation indicates light truck and the p designation indicates passenger car if no letter is given then the application of the tire is passenger car usage as far as i know these letters only appear in the us market the lt designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles for the owner of a passenger vehicle there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a p designation and one with no designation at all if the aspect ratio is omitted it is probably but may be tires with an ms mudsnow designation may have their speed rating reduced by kmh about mph there is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature traction and treadwear temperature and traction are graded a b and c with a the best and c the worst treadwear is a numeric rating these values are of limited value as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of tiresq my car has tires with a funny size designation hr can i put normal tires on the cara your tires are called trx tires they were devised by michelin because of a somewhat different bead design they are incompatible with normal tires michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on trx type wheels you will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car it is barely possible to fit normal tires on trx wheels and horribly dangerous to do so the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner or possibly blow out at high speed trx type tires are becoming hard to find in addition to michelin avon makes suitable tires goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of trx tiresq can i rotate radials from side to side or rotate them only on one side of my cara car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok this group includes michelin and goodyear others for example pirelli and nokia will void warranties if such swapping is done the best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires and stick to the manufacturers recommendationsq how many snow tires should i buy and if i buy which end of the car should i put them ona in short and both ends to explain many drivers in areas that dont get excessive snow or who dont drive agressively or at all in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice with a rear wheel drive car you can choose between being able to start the car going a function of the rear axle or stopping and turning the car a function of the front axle in a front wheel drive car you start stop and turn with the front end the primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes while going downhill you run a serious risk of going downhill backwardsradar detectors and speed limitsq why arent there any comments on radar detectors and speed limits in this qa postinga because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between miscconsumers and recautos always start long tedious and pointless flame wars if you want to talk about either of these topics please subscribe to recautos or altflame and keep it theresafety equipmentq do airbags really worka preliminary statistics suggest the following airbags work much better than no belts good point belts alone work much better than airbags alone and airbags point belts work slightly better than point belts alone the con to airbags is that some designs tend to burn the drivers hands when venting the byproducts of the explosion that occurs inside the bag and that some designs but not all may knock the drivers hands from the wheel making retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficultbrake questionsq do i always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned midas always wants to do thisa no there are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing rotors some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors more often than is strictly necessary if the rotors are not warped warped and only lightly grooved then there is no need to replace or to turn them note also that some rotors the rotors on many hondas are a good example are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical to turn them they must be replaced when they become too thin warped or badly groovedq they tell me i should downshift when braking to slow my car down is this really a good ideaa it used to be a very good idea back in the days of mediocre fade prone drum brakes in modern disc brake equipped cars use of downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary except in cases of long steep downhill runs otherwise modern disc brakes are more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances and they are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings on the other hand many standard drivers license tests in the usa still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking i suggest that before taking a us drivers test you either learn to do this smoothly which takes some time and practice or borrow a car with an automatic to take the testq how often should i replace my brake fluida probably more often than you do traditional brake fluids tend to absorb water this water can corrode internal parts of the brake system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid dot type are older fluids dot and dot are newer specifications the principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points the dry boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid but the wet boiling point is important in older brake fluid dot fluids have the lowest wet and dry boiling point requirements dot fluids have better boiling point requirements and dot fluids have the best boiling point requirements but dot fluids are not clearly superior see the next qa for more details while the requirements imply that dot fluids are better than dot fluids there may be specific cases where a dot fluid is preferable but these are mostly competition applications otherwise dot type fluids offer much improved brake pedal feel replacement once a year is recommended for dot fluids although agressive drivers may profit by changing out fluid more frequently or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid out of the brake calipers fairly regularlyq what about dot brake fluidsa this breaks down in to two parts the dot specification looks excellent for performance but the first dot fluids were silicone based silicone fluids are a tricky proposition unlike dot and dot fluids they do not absorb water at all while this may sound like a feature the problem is that any water present pools up in such systems interfering with braking performance and corroding any metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring the water will tend to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers where most of the corrosion occurs because of this phenomenon it is essential when converting to silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the brake system when converting to silicone fluids two other issues that come up with silicone fluids they are difficult to pour cleanly that is without air bubbles which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel and while they generally have much higher boiling points than dot fluids they do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable in effect from boiling dot fluids silicone fluids may make sense in some street car applications but they are certainly not recommended for high performance driving applications and the economics are questionable for street use i have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the dot standard that do not contain silicones these fluids appear to be reasonably compatible with the older dot and dot fluids but i have little information at this timeq abs is available on some of the cars im looking at but it costs more is it worth ita this does not have a cut and dried answer therefore this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons the short answer is that abs costs more both initially and to maintain will generally work better for the average driver that is to say a driver who does not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques and may require the unlearning of some obsolete braking techniques like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case now for the long answer abs works by monitering the wheels of the car looking for signs of locked brakes it may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheels there are several systems on the market it cannot detect impending lockup which is what you would really want in an ideal world but only the existence of lockup the sensors used vary some of the less well designed sensors are sensitive to tire size and to brake pad material and may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original equipment or oeequivalent components when the sensors detect lockup the abs system responds by unlocking the brakes either individually or all at once depending on the system if the driver keeps their foot firmly planted the abs will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states if a sensor existed that could detect impending lockup then we could sit right at that point which is where maximum braking effect is achieved this pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal as the system cycles the percentage of the time that the brakes are truly engaged is called the duty cycle typically in an abs system this is about on dry pavement a trained driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking on wet pavement braking is so chancy that abs will outperform threshold braking nearly every time unfortunately on mud and on snow often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes locked only audi of the manufacturers producing absequipped cars has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the abs system for this eventuality a particularly important feature of abs is that it preserves steering control this is the case simply because if you are braking near the limit and turn the wheel the abs will release the brakes if it sees steeringtriggered lockup and back off on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied braking distances will lengthen accordingly an important caution abs cannot exceed the maximum theoretical braking force in any given situation if you start sliding on glare ice dont expect an abs system to help you out very much the coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an abs system in your car as far as maintenence goes in addition to the potential restrictions ive listed above you have to worry about the following parts costs are much higher the oe master cylinder for my obscure european sedan lists for but the oe master cylinder for the absequipped version of the same car lists for over most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of dot silicone brake fluids in absequipped vehicles because of the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system components regular i suggest annual replacement of brake fluid becomes very importantq what about this threshold braking businessa normally id not put this in the consumers qa but recent publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers in absequipped chevy caprices suggests that this section is needed here rpw threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high performance drivers if made a habit it replaces the stab the pedal and lock em up panic habit entirely and is much to be prefered basically the premise is that tires generate maximum braking force when they have just started to slide but just before the wheels lock up entirely drivers who threshold brake learn to feel what this threshold feels like and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal in many cars you can feel that you are near the threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it in any case if you cant hear the tires whine just a bit youre not very near the threshold in a car with abs often there is a twinge in the pedal just before the system starts cycling if the driver backs off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt then they are very close to the threshold and theyll probably achieve better stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the abs take over recently there has been a rash of publicity over a number of accidents and one death involving police cars equipped with abs systems the police departments in question quickly blamed the new abs systems but according to autoweek magazine it now seems clear that the problem was a lack of training none of the involved officers had any recent performance driving training there is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing brake pedal by pump braking an old and discredited technique of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal the goal being to try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system if you think about it for a minute youll realize that pump braking must cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least so if you cut the duty cycle of an abs system by that much you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car has abs if you do fear a failed hydraulic system then one or two stabs at the pedal will be sufficient gas questionsq does high octane gasoline helpa maybe maybe not some cars have knock sensors and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used on most cars however you should use the cheapest gas that makes your car run well check your owners manual for details on what your car needsq my car was made for leaded gasoline will unleaded gas hurt ita it is possible that unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear although the amoco oil company argues otherwise the actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable however as modern leaded gasolines actually contain very little lead you should however check your owners manual many cars from the early s do not actually require leaded gasolineq do fuel treatments help what kind should i usea some do and some dont during the winter it is a good idea to use dry gas however some may be harmful to fuel injection systems never use an additive containing methanol sometimes called methyl alcohol such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection manufacturers opinions vary on additives containing ethanol sometimes called ethyl alcohol if your car has fuel injection check the owners manual on your car before using these most manufacturers consider ethanol acceptable in gasoline additives with isopropyl alcohol isopropanol and petroleum distillates are fine in fuel injected cars an occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents that do the same job some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain ethanol or methanol always check the ingredients before putting anything in your gas tank there are a small number of particularly good additives these are noticeably more expensive that the runofthemill ones but work much much better among these are chevron techron redline sl wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber and bg k a bottle of one of these once every six months is highly recommendedq what about detergent gasolinesa the quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat bmw has instituted a testing program and gasoline brands which pass this test may advertise that fact stickers indicating passage of the test are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations if such gasolines are used then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional beforewarned that while use of bmw approved gasolines will keep a clean engine clean they may not clean a motor with bad valve depositslubrication questionsq what do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation meana there are several different items encoded there is a twoletter code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer uses in the oil this looks like sesfcd or such the s codes are for gasoline engine applications the c codes are for diesel engine applications the second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels of protection are developed thus sf is considered better than se se is considered better than sd and so forth the more noticeable designation is the oil weight this is either a single number eg weight or a pair of numbers separated by the letter w eg w the latter type is much more commonly used these days and are the only type that most automobile manufacturers specify in operators manuals the first number in the designation w is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold the w stands for winter the second number is the viscosity of the oil when hot there is a trick here the oil doesnt actually get thicker turn from weight to weight as it gets hotter what is actually happening is that when the oil is cold it has the viscosity of a cold weight oil as it gets hotter it doesnt get thin as fast as a w oil would by the time it is up to temperature it has the viscosity of a hot weight oil note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities not all w oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold and not all weight oils have the same viscosity when hot note also that the novel behaviour of multigrade oils is caused by additives and it has been reported that with the sole exception of castrol gtx w oils do not retain their multigrade characteristics well over time w w and w oils work very well thoughq are quick lube places any gooda some do adequate work but there are quite a few incompetent ones out there let the buyer beware watch them while they work make sure that they dont overtorque the oil drain plug and keep your hand on your wallet at all timesq are oil additives like slick or tufoil any gooda slick and tufoil are ptfebased additives many of these have come onto the market recently they are different from the molybased additives that have been around since the early s ptfe is the chemical name for teflontm a trademark owned by dupont in general auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products most usenet responses to questions on these additives are favorable slight increase of mpg after application smoother revving but long term results whether ptfe additives are effective after k miles are debatable some manufacturers such as saab claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage some bmw owners have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of slick to their cars this writer has been cautioned by a slick dealer that slick should not be used in japanese motors as it may clog the oil return passages in the engine otherwise there are no known reports of damage caused by ptfe additives on the other hand there are satified slick customers in the worldq do synthetic oils really worka yes but more specifically most auto manufactuers accept synthetics but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by oil manufacturers auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your car even if you decide to try the longer intervals at least change the oil filter at regular intervals as synthetics get just as dirty as conventional oils synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter entirely amsoil redline and agip are very highly regarded and very effective mobil synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews howeverq manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals how often should i change my oila it depends on how you drive if your car always or nearly always gets warmed up and you dont drive it very hard and keep the revs down the manufacturers recommendation is probably fine if however you drive it hard drive it at high revs or alternatively if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesnt get up to temperature then you may wish to change oil much more often perhaps at mile intervals given that most manufacturers are now specifying mile intervals if you dont drive your car much at all say miles a year then you probably want to change oil every six months anyway if you are storing a car during the winter then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out of storagemisc questionsq my car has a timing belt i hear that bad things happen when they break whats the storya it depends on the internal design of the motor early ford escorts for example will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks but the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt some honda motors will not be damaged but others will be if no replacement interval is specified for your car then change the belt at least every miles some cars may require more frequent replacement ask your dealer or independent mechanic also ask if there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time for example the same ford escorts that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump which has been known to seize destroying the timing belt and which then causes major valve damage as a side effect replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water pump can be a costly mistakeq why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt breaksa for performance reasons compromising piston design so that the valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression ratio of the engine be reduced significantly this is why you are more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance oriented vehiclesq what causes unintended accelerationa the final report of the national highway transportation and safety administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence the nhtsa report goes on to conclude that pedal misapplication by the vehicle operator is probably the cause richard welty weltycabotballtowncmacomnothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis carroll

the demonstration of thisproduct really impressive if it didnt cheatthe setup of the demo is fairly simple a cone shaped rotor ishalf submerged in a small oil sink filled with motor oil the rotoris

tiretraction qa rpw commonly asked questionsradar questionsq where are radar detectors illegala in the us currently virgina and the district of columbia prohibit all usage of radar detectors new york prohibits their use in large trucks in canada they are illegal in manitoba ontario quebec newfoundland and pei prince edward island they are apparently are illegal through most if not all of europe legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other jurisdictions chances of such legislation passing varies a great dealq where are radar detector detectors used do they really worka usage is spreading rapidly initially they were used only in canada but now they are appearing in new york and virginia it is unsafe to assume that they are not in use in connecticut and dc they work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently available super het radar detectors some brands of detector radiate more strongly than others and are thus more likely to be spotted new radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected by the current generation of detector detectors note that a detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned onq what is vascar is it some kind of radara vascar is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and timespeeddistance computer it depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target vehicle passes landmarks no radar signals are emitted by a vascar systemq what is ka band radar where is it used should a radar detector be able to handle it a ka band has recently been made available by the fcc for use in the us in socalled photoradar installations in these installations a lowpowered beam is aimed across the road at a degree angle to the direction of traffic and a picture is taken of vehicles which the radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle because of the low power and the degree angle many people believe that a radar detector cannot give reasonable warning of a ka band radar unit although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such capability anyway the number of locales where photoradar is in use is limited and some question the legality of such units best advice learn what photo radar units look like and keep track of where they are used or else dont speedq do radar jammers work are they legala quick answer no and not in the usa detailed answer cheap radar jammers do not work well at all jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the military jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the federal communications commission of the usadriving technique and vehicle dynamics questionsq what are understeer and oversteera understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a car while cornering near the limit limit of adhesion that is most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to be descriptive of the situations they encounter simply put they tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner steer less or understeer or it wants to turn more in a corner oversteer understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that untrained drivers inadvertantly traveling too fast wont get into trouble understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle in a corner oversteer is designed into some more performance oriented cars it may be induced by lifting on the throttle trailing throttle oversteer or tto in extreme cases lifting on the throttle may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or spinning some technical details in a corner at speed the tires on the car will develop what are called slip angles the slip angle is the angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to travel in understeer the front wheels have a greater slip angle than the rear wheels in oversteer the rear wheels have a greater slip angle than the front wheelsq what is a revmatched downshifta when downshifting the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear than it was in the higher gear however during a downshift normally you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle so the revs drop rather than increase in revmatched downshift you blip the throttle before reengaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to the new speed this results in a much smoother and faster downshiftq what does heelandtoe meana heelandtoe is a technique used to do a revmatched downshift while braking this is normally challenging because you need the right foot for both the brake and throttle it is called heelandtoe because you use one end of the foot on the brake and the other on the throttle to match revs for the downshift in many modern cars this is a misnomer often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side on the throttle note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch and just use the left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle accomplishing the same thingq what is doubleclutch downshiftinga while your right foot is doing the above your left foot can do one of three things nothing declutch once or declutch twice the reason for declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the transmission to the speed of the engine this is usually coupled with revmatching so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch engaged the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission speed up the procedure is as follows declutch move gearshift lever to neutral engage clutch match revs declutch move gearshift lever to next lower gear engage clutch this sounds like a lot of work but with practice it becomes natural the problem that doubleclutching solves is normally the function of the synchronizers within the gearbox in transmissions without synchros or with very worn synchros doubleclutching makes it much easier to shift basically if you doubleclutch well you are not using the synchros at all this is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good conditionq what do the numbers for acceleration from mile skidpad and slalom times in the auto magazines really mean may they be compareda in short not as much as the magazines want you to believe and almost never in more detail the acceleration numbers mph and mile times in the us may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the same source testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine that comparing a road track number to a car driver number is quite pointless keep in mind too that the same variation applies from driver to driver on the street the driver is a major often the major part of the equation skidpads vary and even if they didnt skidpad figures are really only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires they change radically when tire compounds change do not make any assumptions about the comparative handling of say two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers this is not to suggest that skidpads are without value however skidpads are an excellent educational tool at driving schools they are simply of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires slalom times are slightly more useful they test some small parts of the automobiles transient response however they are also heavily influenced by the stock rubber on the car and they do not test many corners of the cars envelope they do not tell you all you need to know before making a buying decision for example they dont tell you what the rear end of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes offcamber when a car has an adjustable suspension these tests are usually done in the sport setting which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving the list of caveats could go on for page after pageq my buddy claims that wide tires dont make any difference according to his freshman physics textbook and that you cant ever accelerate or corner at more than g does he know what hes talking abouta in short he hasnt got a clue in more detail the equations for friction used in freshman physics textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth dry and nondeformable none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating temperature pavement is never smooth it is always irregular to a greater or lesser extent tires which are not really dry and solid as rubber is a substance which in its natural form is liquid and which has only been coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic deform to match the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over in a tire at operating temperature grip is actually generated by shear stresses inside the deformed rubber and not by anything even remotely resembling friction in the freshman physics sense of the term the colder a tire is relative to its operating temperature the closer its behaviour will be to the traditional concept of friction if much hotter than the its proper operating temperature the more likely the possibility of some part of the tire actually reverting to liquid which is mostly like to happen deep in the tread causing characteristic blisters and chunking this latter though is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal street driving so unless youre a competition driver or do a lot of high speed track driving dont worry about it because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all thus dragsters accelerate at more than g and race cars corner and brake at more than g because simple friction does not apply it is actually possible for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of grip an actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques such as finite element analysis due to the complexity of the mechanismmisc questionsq what does name or acronym stand fora here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked about be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names as misinformation abounds on the net in particular never ask in rechumor if you want a useful result saab svenska aeroplan a b or the swedish airplane corporation alfa societa anonima lombarda fabbrica automobili or the lombardy automobile manufacturing company

someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they are blocking traffic i use my blinker or flash my lights or if all else fails will briefly speed up slow down so they might get the

an experience a fewyears ago that might be interesting to you i owned a toyota celicagt i decided to buy myself a gift a more exotic car front runnersincluded the toyota supra turbo and the porsche model yearsi narrowed it down to those two i liked the simplicity and handlingand snob appeal too of driving a porsche the supra turbo was lessmoney and had more features and performance almost a personal luxurycar it had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the i was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the but idecided to stop by my insurance agents office on the way i askedabout what would happen to my rate with either car if you buy the supra your rate classification will be the same asthe celica the celica was considered a subcompact and for thatyear was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase becausethe car will be years newer our lowerrisk division will continueto handle your account if you buy the porsche well have to change you to the standardhigher rate company and your rate will double and if you go witha its another story again well cover the rest of this yearbut cancel you after that but the supra is much faster than the and the is actuallyfaster than the standard that doenst make sense thats what the book says we dont insure corvettes either forsome reason the underwriters consider supras and their drivers as very traditional and conservative i eventually went with the supra for a number of reasons the porschedealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough highpressureguy in the back room at equal monthly payments it would have takena year longer to pay for the porsche plus its higher insurance iconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of autotheft everyones entitled to my

when the electronics figure it not when the driver setsthe switch which is the proper way to do it imo so what does sportmode entail several things revving to red line or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy delayed upshifts ie if you lift off briefly it will remain in thelow gear this is handy if you are charging through corners andwould like to do without the distraction of upshifts when theresanother curve approaching part throttle downshifts based on the speed at which the pedal isdepressed rather than the position of the pedal modernelectronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport modethis is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light aboutto turn red my audi senses this very well and can downshift on aslittle as half throttle if my right foot is fast enoughalso i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileagethan a dumb driver with a stick all else being equal remember thatthe idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes abig assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear touse for each situation how many times have you ridden with aninattentive driver cruising on the highway at in th gear of a speed how many of people who drive manuals really know what the bestgear to use is for every conceivable situation im sure there willbe some who know but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic withall possible scenarioratio combinations stored in rom is likely to dobetter i can also say that all my previous assumptions were provedwrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout high

someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast to ban the ozonedepleting cfc chemicals and not gasolines and other greenhousegasproducing compounds the greenhouse effect produced by infraredtrapping gasses like co and methane and the ozonehole problem produced by longlived chlorinecontaining molecules are not the same thing it is a lot easier to do something about not using the cfcs chlorofluorocarbons than it is to stop producing co and methane which are natural byproducts of combustion and of living animal organisms planting more trees and not destroying so many

can get an for or less not much less you said your not looking to go fast they are a really nice car just not real powerfulin addition to restricted mileage many classic insurance carriers also

for the date of the odometer as easy as this is i dont know why manafucturers dont do it dont they to prevent illegal odometer tamperingbut as a previous writer said it will in any case take aeons to reset an odometer mechanic or electronic by simulating a driving car it will be easier to reprogram it how i dont knowit shouldnt be that hard if you know much about digital electronics if thecounter is made with standard ttl chips all you should need to do is findthe chips used for counting figure out what mileage you want to put inand preset it but wiring the preset pins directly to lowhigh youd also haveto know what the conventions are for low and high it might be a little moreinvolved than this but it shouldnt be beyond someone with a bsee or bs eetall the display does is convert what the counter chips say into digits usinga translation table stored in romselahdanbut those chips are probably inside a custom chip to make it smaller anduse less power and the presetdata pins are not going to be availableit would probably not be ttl but might be cmos wider operating voltage range not that the tecnology would make much differenceplus the custom chip would probably be potted encapsulated

the differentials and do the oil change there my previous wrangler had nary a problem either here in colorado there more jeeps than bmws mercedes volvos and the like together in fact jeep has been called the colorado car for a while they hold their value well and are very easy to resell mine cost right around k new of course i didnt blow money on an islander sahara or renegade which i have a wrangler sahara and paid new including the rebate are just wranglers with fancy inside stuff after driving a cj for years that fancy stuff is pretty nice the cars are primitive ride like a dump truck etc but if you live in an area that gets around of snow per winter youd have one too theyll go anywhere with a winch and are easy to get parts for the i like my wrangler but when doing some serious off roading it cantkeep up with a cj because of ground clearance and limited suspensiontravel i do have a winch and would like to get an arb airlocker in thefuture l engine puts out hp and gets around

the muchcheaper or one of several mercedes or audi models all of thesecars are fairly expensive but so are the parts that make themdrivable at high speed this should be elementarythere are a few things to keep in mind about europe since you broughtit up my autobahn knowledge is admittedly secondhand but i believethe following to be true drivers are much better disciplined in europe than they are heretrue of northern europe latin countries are something else the roads comprising the autobahn are much better designed thankindof true remember they were build by adolf in the s they are here and usually include animal fences this makes them far more predictable than most us highwaysyes not all of europe is the autobahn most places in europe haveautobahn is the german word for freeway other countries havedifferent names for loose equivalents autostrada autoroute motorwayetc speed limits that arent outofline with what we used to have in the us if my friends werent lying to me theyre typically not much higher than kmheurope did seem on the brink of a kmh limit it hasnt passed asfar as i know typical speeds in western europe are much higher thanthe us law enforcement is negligible in my experience comapredto the us as there is no revenue enhancement motivation the thingsyou really notice are the higher speed differentials and the moreprofessional attitude to driving you just never see two carsrunning parallel at mph oblivious to all around themi strongly suspect you wont find a lot of rabbit owners doing mphnearly kmh on the autobahn but i could be wrong some peopleyoure wrong gtis go this fast just kind of noisy not the idealautobahn car a lot of times you see cars being driven with the driversfoot on the floor how do i know when youre not making any groundon the identical car in front of youhave no respect for their own livesif something happens at youre dead but the same goes for muchover driving at high speed forces you to concentrate i feel muchsafer driving on the autobahn than in typical us trafficbecause most people seem to be awake ive never seen any driver readinga book on an autobahn i see it all too often in the uscraigit just doesnt seem

its an automatic dont know if us speccdn spec for maximasthe car has km or about miles on ita typical mileage for cars seem to be about km or about k mithe seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certificationhe was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replacedto meet the legal standards he said he will replace the components beforeselling the car to mebeing copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars i dont knowwhat this could meanis k km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned itemsor is this an indication that the car was abusedif it is the first set of brake pads on front then this is fine my careats a set every k miles or so the fact that he is replacing themuffler too is also okwould other things break down or have to be replaced soonthe mileage is fairly low but typical fwd stuff is cv joints checkthe maintenance records with the manufacturers requirements for valveadjustments timing belt changes and so onthe k mile service is often expensive so make sure he has done everythingthe seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot buti dont know how to verify this ive seen the paint chipped awayin tiny dots in the front edge of the hood thoughwell this is one of the commonly cited methods for identifying acar with highway miles might check the gas pedal wear too ask him how many sets of tires hehas been through a highway car might have squeezed by on setsa hard driven car setsalthough the maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean andwell kept its currently out of warrantya similarly priced accord with k km will have years or k kmworth of warranty left and i dont want to worry about paying forany repair billswell the maxima should be pretty reliable but if its out of warrantyyou should get it checked out by someone knowledgeable first stufffor japanese cars can be expensivebut i also need a car for people when will the new maxima come out by the way model year i believe i

admittedly secondhand but i believethe following to be truemy knowledge about driving in the us is also secondhand but i think i cancorrect your statements about our autobahn drivers are much better disciplined in europe than they are hereoh yeah that would be paradise in fact you can forget it from all iveheard from my us relatives drivers esp here in germany are much more aggressive but not disciplined one of my relatives a la resident hired a carat the nuernberg airport and went about miles to our home he said then thathe grew about year older during this ride and swore hed never drive a car ingermany again this was in and he kept his promise the situation now iseven worse as effect of the increased volume of trafficwhat you mean by better disciplined should perhaps be considered cautious dueto fear when driving around here you always have to take into consideration that themajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you they expect that nobodyfails or sleeps many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car cango of course only where that is allowed you might think dream on so any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health and if youre exposed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver you learn tohandle it or you lose thats the way i and most people i know experience our traffic situation whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you i think we handlea very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest compared tothe volume and decreasing rates of lethal accidents otoh more and morepeople esp women dislike driving because they feel overtaxed and threatenedand each accident is one accident too much the roads comprising the autobahn are much better designed than they are here and usually include animal fences this makes them far more predictable than most us highwaysbetter designed and maintained may be but animal fences are very rare autobahnen and many other streets have guardrails i hope thats the right word a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights its about feet highthose guardrails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road smaller animalscan crawl under the plank bigger ones can easily jump over it the point isthat esp larger animals are very rare in germany they tend also to be verytimid accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger not all of europe is the autobahn most places in europe have speed limits that arent outofline with what we used to have in the us if my friends werent lying to me theyre typically not much higher than kmhyoure right there are speed linits even on the major part of the autobahn but the attitude towards driving see above seems to be very similar to thatin germany ive been in france switzerland italy austria spain belgiumthe netherlands besides that you really cant rely on the residents abidingthe local speed limits ive got quite a lot of practise k miles and imused to travel at mph fyi with a car even smaller than a rabbit but iconsider driving on the highways round paris or milano really a thrilli strongly suspect you wont find a lot of rabbit owners doing mphnearly kmh on the autobahn but i could be wrong sorry but youll find quite a lot rabbitclasscar or even smaller mine is apeugeot owners going that fast small cars with much hp are very hip overhere and most people buying such cars arent afraid to let them run some peoplehave no respect for their own livesi disagree the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant formula carsweigh less than kg and the drivers have a chance to survive

moreinsurance than whats included in the base price but on the other hand he didnt rent it from alamodoes anyone have some info on thisis a ripoff no that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that cityprobability that ill be needing more insuranceunless you have an accident you wont need more if you plan onpaying for the car with a credit card check and see if your cardautomatically covers rental cars also your own auto insurance maycover rental cars alsomost rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent andrequire you to initial in several spots if you dont want it thecredit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort ofcoverage that the rental agency is trying to selli have never rented from alamo so i dont know if they follow thissame practiceis the beretta a good rental caryes it is a compact door probably a bit dull performance andaccelerationwise but very adequate it will have an automatictransmission amfm stereo air conditioning and

second note that the auto tranny in fstill shifts at the drivers command not some preselected schedule thedriver still controls the shifting not the transmission now there is no dispute that in production cars automatics are inherently more lossy than manuals that is in theory my point all along is that whatever mechanical advantages a manual has over an automatic can very easily be lost by a driver who isnt skillful orone thing that gives an automatic an advantage at launch is the fact thatit has a torque converter vs a clutch i know this sounds strange buta torque converter multiplies the engine output when launching it functions as a sort of limited continuously variable transmission typically you get a torque multiplication of to times depending on the stall speedi have yet to see a torque multiplier installed on a production automobile such systems do exist but none are presently installed in production autosthat i am aware of these are commonly called viscous drive cvts orfluidic amplifiers contrasted to a clutch which merely slips when feathered result is no tq multwhat the convertor does allow is for the engine to be closer to itstorque peak during the launch before a clutched car can fully engage itsdriveline chevy proved it many years ago with the camaro ets andterminal mile times were close enough tpo be identical for speed andauto cars note that this is also the major reason that an auto car canget away with fewer gears than a manual the slip in the convertor makes upfor the fewer ratios and before everyone starts yelling about the proposed sspeed autos soon to be out note that some manufacturers are using speed manulas now once past lauch however the converter begins coupling and the tq multiplicationeffect is reduced but by then you should be

know if it is possible to fix the problem without replacingthe whole carburetorthank youfrom jackwboihpcom jack woodsubject bbb autoline arbitrationmy bbb autoline arbitration experience is over the outcome was decidedly mixed i won the battle but lost the war the arbitrator found that the car was defective but decided to offer a repurchase well below market value at the time of the hearing average retail on my truck in the nada book was but the decision was for i wrote a letter to the council of better business bureaus pointing out the fact that if you have an automobile that does not depreciate rapidly the manufacturer has no incentive to deal with you there is no way that the manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded a repurchase the attitude of chevrolets representative at the hearing tends to support this point of view he was totally unprepared and did not seem to take the proceeding very seriouslyi decided to take the repurchase even though i am getting totally screwed on the price i will not have to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon myself and i have no case for a civil suit based on the idaho lemon law i am planning to send a letter to my elected representatives telling them how utterly ridiculous the idaho lemon law is the law allows for a use deduction equal to the irs mileage allowance as if chevrolet were buying my gas and paying for my insurancesummary of the case in may i bought a new tonhd chevrolet pickup between may and december this vehicle required repair after repair systems that required attention included the transmission heater fan paint suspension and motor the main problem was the five speed manual transmission they could not install a nondefective transmission in at least four attemptsso in summary it is possible to get a repurchase but you are going to get screwed on the price unless you paid too much in the first place or if your

these areas are not meant for this type of discussion if you feel the need to do such things please take your thought elsewhere thanks i just want to second this request i value this net group as one where peoplefocus on solving problems and go out of their way to be respectful ofdifferences the hostility expressed in the original posting feels like anassault thanksjan exactly my point there is a lot of hostility to and from teenagers look i sent these posts here to altparentsteens with a copy to recautos since you people in this group may have the best advice for and experience with troubled teenagers if you follow the news for the northwest usa you will have heard that a group of year old boys barely out of the teens certainly their outlook was developed during their teens just shot and killed an innocent little girl riding in a car in the seattle area when her mother who was driving honked her horn at the car with the boys in it this is really upsetting and makes my stomach turn as it would any parents doesnt your heart just go out to that poor motheryes fred my heart and prayers go out to the mother and others who have been victims of these and other senseless crimes you folks in this group have a responsibility to offer any good advice that you may have i suspect lots of people all over the world will read and appreciate your commentshowever i feel that you have missed the point of the previous postings see top your statement of responsibility is felt as an attack towards the members of this group you are attempting to make the members of this groupbe required to answer the only people who should make a statement are peoplewho have experienced the problem and found a workable solution teenagers both drive cars and are involved in automotive vandalism and crime maybe someone on this newsgroup has had specific experience in dealing with violent teenage offenders like these kids are at the same time maybe you would have some good advice for those hostile people who sense that are now the potential victims maybe you would have some good advice for them on how not to pay back andor not make the situation worse maybe you have some good advice for local authorities or schools where this problem is prevalent but then again maybe youre not interested many people are interested but have no input i will restate that your lastsentence here is seen as an attack on the members of this group if people haveinput they will give it if they do not you should not make them feel compelled sp to respond if you wish to continue this conversation please send email do not

but it will end when they leave you in the lurchive read in this group that geico has funded the purchasing of radarguns by police depts im not sure wheremore than that geico funded the company that developed lidar when locals showed a reluctance to buy the units geico started giving them away i know theyve given units to the florida highway patrol county sheriffs a and some local governmentsthe real question is why this is the hook geico and other ins cos can tell which drivers represent risk this is a determination they can make after you receive a speeding ticket from one of geicos lidar units most drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two but this gives them the opportunity to raise rates for equal risk its called extra profits they also know how silly the nsl is and how it is almost universally ignored driving in excess of the nsl gets you a ticket an increase in your rates points on your license but it doesnt make you a riskier driver to insurelike

point here is trust and reliability ive been able to trust the valentine more than any other detector ive owend if the valentine says that there is a moderate to strong radar source in front of me then its more than likely to be a speed trap with my other detectors ive gotten so many falses that ive begun to ignore someo of the warnings because i didnt want to drive like i had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedalthat directional indicator really really helps plus more info is almost always better than less info no matter how smart radar detectors get the human brain is usually smarter so if im going to make a decisio based on information at hand i want all the info i can get plus if you divide the overall strength of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported youll find that eachbogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat with other detectors youll just get one strong warning my logic may be faulty on this but i think it works okayalthough i must admit

frankbsadhpcom frank ballsubject re rfi art of clutchless shifting im not familiar with the trannies used in winston cup but in the transam cars ive played with the transmissions were the racing variety with dog clutches instead of sychros in a transmission with dog clutches the gears are always engaged with each other and moving the dog clutches engages the gears to the shafts motorcycle transmissions are the same way shifting without the clutch on a transmission with syncros can and will cause transmission damage the only question being how long it takesto grenade something for the trans in my pulsar se it was about k miles but it had a weak tranny in the first place just out of curiosity how is this dog clutch any different from a synchro transmission what you described sounds the same to me in fact what little ive studied on trannies the instructor referred to the synchros as dogs and said they were synonymous the gears are always meshed in a synchronized gearbox and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting or at least that is what i was taught explain por favourmotorcycle transmissions dont have synchros the engagment dogs are verycorse and sloppy there are maybe teeth dogs on the side of thegears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears backand forth to shift start to apply pressure at the same time theclutch is pulled the clutch is a hand lever and shift quickly if you try a slow lazy shift it will grind you just have to pop it intothe next gear before it has a chance to grind there isnt a neutralbetween gears obviously there is but you cant select it with theshifter so double clutching is not a possibility speed shiftingwhich is what i have always heard clutchless shifting called workspretty well for upshifts with some practice but i usually use theclutchespecially for the lower gearsi think auto as in automobile trannys are similar except that theengagment dogs are very fine with no slop and the addition ofsyncho

someone rock the car back and forth less than an inch while i depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter the shifter acted normally after thatwhen this happened i took it to the dealer they checked the clutch it was ok they checked the transmission it was oki had the exact problem a couple of months ago and again lastweek the dealer says there is nothing they can do because mitsubishi the says

cant wait anyone outthere hear anything about it recentlyif everything ive read is correct ford is doing nothing but reskinning the existing mustang with minor suspension modificationsand the pictures ive seen indicate they didnt do a very good jobof itthe new mustang is nothing but a recycle of a year old cargee is it alreadyyes it will still be on the fox program chasis anything that will be different on the new car as far as mechanicals is unknown the suspension will mostlikely be changed as well as the drive drain from what has been printed onit there is no clear idea of what will be done as some say it will havethe modular v and others the current small block just have to wait and seealso is far as styling goes from what i seen is good a return to traditionc scoop on the sides

know thats mho the differences these days between ford and gm are not so much the qualityjust the philosophy it used to be quality and philosophy gm isbarely catching up but they have more room for

rocking moments thei has a second order shaking force while the flat has a secondorder rocking moment the significant thing about the flat ssecond order moment is that it can be easily balanced out by addingmass at the ends of the crank the i however requires a counterrotating shaft with mass to balance out the second order forcesi am sure that subaru and porsche use the boxer configurationand not

getfront and rear sensorsyou can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the copdoesnt see it right awayvalentine is the best detector by far as statedby car and driver and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from it also gives the amount of threats it is picking up so if you go through the same place everyday and it always goes off there you can glance at the

but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behaviorafter the mn thunderbird cost and weight debacle ford decided independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive wont be tried again in a volume car the current l v will soldier on for about two years a version ofthe valve modular v in the mark viii could be offered then fordis spending big money tooling up for l and l v engines which

been periodically feeding the clutchhydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system i knew iwould be selling the car and didnt want to go all the way to solving theproblemi should add that the clutch is original and that ive had to adjust thepedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder inorder to actuate the clutchmy hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedalthe angle of the piston rod attached to the pedal is off the axix of thecylinder thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming itwhat do you think of that as an explanation can you suggest a possible fixshort of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put innow the same problem except that the above diagnosis doesnt explainwhy all of

drive my convertable for miles or less per year i must keep it in a locked garage and it will cost me of the stated value per year does this sound right ive also been looking at vettes recently and found a convertiblethat i like at a dealer i currently own an ford escort gt whichis insured through state farm i called em up and asked about the rates if i sell the escort the vette insurance is per months if i keep the escort the vette insurance is per months theescorts insurance goes down by to approx per months im male and have a good driver discount another variable wouldbe where you live best bet is to just call up some insurance brokersand get a quote state farm says they base the price on the fair market value of the carwhich is determined by an outside apprasier they look in the newspaperand call up dealers to find out what the going rate is and adjust it forthe condition of the car to get the values above they went on the selling price of the car thedealers asking price is i need to do research to find out ifthis is reasonable in any case i told state farm the value was kget an appraiser to look at the car he will check serial numbers and look for origional equipe depending on what mods have been done the car could be worth only k problems like wrong engine trans wrong paint type vetts used lacquer an modification would reduce tthe value but your looking for a

appreciate the large trunk as i pack upfor a hour drive to washington dc for the summer more on theride later in this reviewengine as with anyone even slightly interested in shos i was veryinterested in the valve l yamaha shogun engine i was notdisappointed base performance of the engine under rpms isgood you can even do reasonable launches from second gear althoughi dont make a practice of this the engine revs smoothly and eagerly tooling around town does not require many shifts this is goodsince the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the carmore on this later while the performance of the engine under rpms may beunremarkable it undergoes a jekyllhyde transformation once you hithigher revs at rpms a butterfly valve opens and you canliterally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelvemore valves open up the engine soars to its rpm redline andyou are treated to in my opinion the sweetest sounding v aroundthe engine inexplicably sounds overjoyed to be at rpm ive noticed that when i drive around town i constantly watch thetach to see how far below rpm i am to go from rpm to you may have to punch the accelerator while torque is more thanadequate it doesnt come fully online until those other valvesare usedtransmission when car and driver first reviewed the car in theymarvelled at how ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifterinto the car i remember driving a friends parents sho in andremember thinking about whether i had the leg strength to drive thecar in traffic the clutch was that stiff that was back then the entire clutch assembly on my sho has been replaced under aford recall in the clutch on the sho feels no stiffer than theone on my toyota celica in fact the friction point seems a bitlarger and more forgiving when playing with the shifter with the car parked the shifterfelt very reasonable the and gates were where youd expectit to be and the shifting action was smooth on the road itsmuch the same but you have to shift slowly make no mistake itsa clumsy shifter when hurrying shifts like when i was initially trying to impressfriends i consistently miss the shift often grope clumsily forthe shift and sometimes even muff the shift i find thispretty amazing in a car like this it also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothestshifts when you take your time seems obvious but compared to mytoyota and my friends honda this seems atrocious and clumsysomeone on recautos noted that crxs should blow shos offthelinebecause of the incredibly clumsy shifter i now shift much more sedately and the shifter seems morereasonable when you play within these bounds the shifter workssmoothly with no surprises i dont know whether the rod shifterupgrade would help at all along these same lines i initially had trouble shifting gearssmoothly again slowing down the shifts and taking more care tomatch revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely this tookseveral days for me to get the hang of i think some of my problemswere because ive never had a car with enough power to balk at badshifts in higher gears occasionally i have trouble shifting into reverse the shifterrefuses to enter the gate and i often grind the synchros trying to get it into gear ill be watching this carefully in the next coupleof months a quirk when i upshift and the engine drops back to rpm i hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the theengine compartment not terribly loud but the passenger candefinitely hear it i asked about it when i was looking at the caras do all my passengers apparently this is a definitely a shosound and is the gearbox apparently called gear rolloverreplies to my queries on recautos are at the end of this reviewexterior as i mentioned before i am astounded by how well the body of thissho has stood up paint chipping on the front bumper and grille arevirtually nonexistent looking at how older tauri sometimesdont age so gracefully i wonder what the guys at ford diddifferently to the sho bodies the body in my opinion is extremely attractive with matchingcolor body moldings than the stock tauri for some odd reason thesho seems different enough from vanilla tauri to get stares atstoplights of course this could be my overactive imagination shos get fog lights a more open grille a completelymonochromatic exterior and a deeper ground skirt in the back withsho stenciled in relief ive seen a couple shos whose owners havecolored these in with florescent colors or in black yuck i dont think the car is flashy i like it that way i feelalmost anonymous with all those tauri out there but different anddistinctive enough to those of us who care interior the interior is what really makes me feel like i dont deserve thecar the seats are grey leather the steering wheel and shifter arecovered with black leather and the entire instrument panel is done ina blackgreymetallic scheme the instrumentation is stock taurus except for the mph speedoand rpm tach you get a center console with two cupholders alarge compartment under the radio great for a cd player an armrestthat contains yet another compartment three appropriately sized coinholders for tollways i think and a compartment for holdingcassette tapes theres mapholders in the doors and an oddly smallglove compartment i spilled a whole can of coke in the cupholder and was delightedto find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in asink hey im really impressed with the ergonomics andthoughtfulness that went into its design and its a before theinterior was upgraded the backseat is bigger than any car ive had why do they need somuch space no smartass comments please the driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters fromwhat i hear its not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wearmine is no exception the left side bolster on the drivers hascracked and im not convinced the right bolster is inflating all theway a big surprise for me i forgot that shos dont have a normalhand parking brake instead they have the regular parking brake thatyou press with your left foot too bad again im getting used toit but it seems a bit anachronistic to meride the suspension is nice and stiff too stiff its stiffer thanany car ive had a friends new toyota celica st seems tauterand is still able to soak up bumps better the sho seems stiffer withless ability to soak up bumps driving over railroad tracks is anoisy and jarring affair on the other hand taking turns feelswonderful because the body is so rigid and doesnt flex at all ilistened for that before i bought the car on the highway the ride is great when i drove the car fromchicago back to purdue i had trouble keeping under mph let alonefrom trying to see what mph really feels like its a relativelyquiet ride but the sunroof rattles ive tried to find out whatexactly makes all the noise up there but it seems to be the windowthat rests on the rails no easy way to get rid of it i think over the past three days ive oscillated between thinking thesuspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is waytoo rough not for me mind you but i wonder whether i wouldadvise my dad to buy one for himself but ive discovered as withthe shifter if you take your time with shifts youll have no reasonto complain let me explain the ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to thewheels i feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steermaking the car skitter left and right after i understood this iavoid the limits of traction and im a happy camper again its not body rigidity but the composure of the car as if matching the suspension the steering feel is quite heavymy first impression of driving my sho was how hard you had to turn thewheel at highway speeds it tracks straight as an arrow but whendriving around a parking lot the higheffort steering didnt seem souseful however its reasonable but it doesnt communicate the roadto the driver as well as a ford probe gt imho its much betterthan the steering on my celica st i wonder how bad this car is during wintermiscellaneous notes gripes the rattles from the sunroof is intermittent some days it rattles loudly other days i look up wondering where all the noise went activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy loud squealing asit retracts on its rails i wonder if there is a quick fix for thisagain other days it completely disappears function of humidity once i made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspensionand torque steer ive never complained about ride i wish the seats had more support under the thighs also i wish theside bolsters would close more tightly i hear that tires for this car can get really expensive icurrently have goodyear gts that cost the previous owner for four i used to hate the ford stereo systems whose idea was itto use a volume paddle now to my amazement i dontreally mind and sometimes think its an okay ideapretty ridiculous though getting up to rpm sometimes seems to be a chore butthis is no big deal there is more than enough torquedown low i often goof up the shifting when driving with friends ittook me a couple of days before i could really shiftsmoothly from nd to rd gear hard to believe isnt it my car has almost miles on it my parents noted thatit is almost impossible to find a lowmileage sho astute observation imho i wonder how long i can makemy sho last i just bought a book titled drive it foreverfor tips in this department the goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop i onceparked the car in gear and then accidentally let out the clutchafter i started it the car jolted forward and bounced offthe car in front of me no paint damage at all but starting the car is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal also i began to wonder how strong that brake really is today i backed out of parking spot today and started to drive away before i noticed the glowing brake light oops the drivers power window creaks when closed all the way the same thing happens in my parents mercury sable oddly all theother windows work smoothly likes im liking the interior amenities more and more each day the cupholders are great i didnt expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much butit really is handy you can lock all the doors bypressing the and buttons together neat andyou can never lock yourself out of the car i really feel like i dont deserve this car i really cantbelieve that i could afford it i got this car ten years ahead of schedule i love this car so much that ive been telling my parents tolook into buying one i love this car so much that iwrote this k file i meant to write a couple of linesand ended up with this if there were a jd powers survey for used car owners i would havean opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this car i dont like thinking about getting another car but at thispoint in time im sure id buy another sho for under youcant beat it next time with an airbag and abs though insurancewise this car is also a big win i pay the same premiumsas on my toyota celica despite that it has nearly twicethe horsepower other odds and ends much to my amazement there is no sho mailing list anywheremaybe because the sho registry publication has filled this void ihavent joined yet but ive noticed that queries about shos stillappear on recautos about once a month owners of shos are alwaysquick to respond and are very vocal fans of the cars maybe someof the most vocal on recautos ive put together the responses to my questions about the cars

worth of repairs over its lifetime i am sorry but lee iacocca can biteme bullshit whoever backs em best is just afraid the stupid things aregoing to fall apart and no one will buy them without assurance why thehell do you think that lh has been nicknamed last hopeyou can do better and i know people will disagree with me here butjapanese like honda or toyota or the only american car company that ifeel is a quality product saturn i will not touch another chryslerproduct again no way i dont care how good the lh cars look good and iwill admit they look promising but not with the support that you get gmisnt much better thank god they dont control saturn like they dotheir divisions or it would be just another marketing ploy dont get me wrong i will be watching my car which i do like like ahawk for the next years i am much more hesitant to say it or any caris really good until it has proved itself to mebut since someone else pointed out cd as a source i will note becausei used to read these magazines that car and driver has never had a goodthing to say about most chrysler products shadow for one always werethey moaning about the reguritated kcar and engine whereas motor trendalways thought they were great cars no car magazine is really objectiveand although there are alot of people who dont like consumers reports iwill use them to reinforce my argument i already know about the big stinkwith the saturn crash tests time will tell how good a car they are theshadowsundance rate much worse than average in fact none of thechryslers rate a better than average i think the best one is justaverage excluding the diamond starmitsubishi stuff and the lhs youcan find bad stuff about the shadow try as i might when i researchedthe saturn i could not find anything bad about it there is a great dealof information about this company just because it is a new americancompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community forgood reason much more than the introduction of any new model lines ofany established company i read an article which had a subcolumn an ithink this imprinted on me more than anything else some big wig intoyota said and i quote we are watching them very closely come oneverybody grow up the foreign cars especially the japanese have beenkicking our butts for good reason the american car companies could not makea good product or support the customer the way they want these days toset in their ways which is one of the reasons saturn was created theyare still struggling because they havent learned yet they have theability the

audi s quattroits been a while since ive reviewed a car but today i paid a visitto an old friend whose love for audis has been so overwhelming that hemakes a not too sucessful living selling themwithout further delay i will get to the audi s servotronic steeringfor those who are not familiar with what servotronic is it is thename for the speed variable power steering manufactured by zf andused in audis and bmwsi have been outspoken in my damming of servotronic over the pastcouple of months and this was based on magazine reviews and drives ofthe audi cs quattro and the audi cs fwd i am quite happy toreport now that on the s the servotronic is inoffensive isuppose that due to the fat gumball tires the servotronic has beenloaded up more and this so far has been the best implementation thati have tried it is far from perfect mind you and id be muchhappier if it was an option that i could refuse but on the s i nolonger consider this to be bad enough where i feel the entire car isruinedthe steering is still a tad too light but it is accurate and isuppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information thatsome makes it through to the drivers hands so there is feel andthere is accuracy in the ss steering but there is also room forimprovement i consider the ss steering to be better than thejapanese competition primarily because the japanese do not believe infeel and engineer it out completely enginewheee what a pressure cooker with just miles on the clock i didnot expect the s to be producing anywhere close to what it will beputting out miles later but still the car packs a terrificpunch for a turbocharged machine it is very unusual in that itencourages lazy driving ie low revs high gear it is sosupremely flexible that one could hardly believe that theres only liters of displacement to move this pound car around in such afashion with maximum torque available at rpm and a rpmredline the car can pretty much be left in third all day whichtranslates to a speed range of something like mph achracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity vsthe technical achievement is breadthtakingthrottle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine infact it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame downshiftsare almost unnecessary it is more fun to use the overboost featurethan to rev the engine for those not familiar the s engine featuresup to seconds of additional turbo boost for passing sort of likelighting up the after burners in a jet fighter one could with theright foot only in third gear blast the car from to in just afew moments simply by flooring the gas as far as the numbers gomaximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about lbft incredible for a liter it takes a few moments for it todevelop overboost but it is well worth waiting for since this is quitea heavy car ones body parts are not flung around like say the corradovr the acceleration is smooth and strong somewhat similar to ridingin a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff also oneis treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from theturbo the only entertaining sound to come out of a veryrefined but bland sounding bangeryes audi has refined the to the point where at rpm it sounds asserene as it does at the smoothness is outstanding but not quiteup to the standards of a very good eg a valve bmw id say thatin terms of refinement ie willingness to rev smoothness lack ofharshness under full acceleration it is better than many vs howeverlost in the refinement process is the characteristic cylinder barkthat made the older engines so characterful if not terribly refinedthe valve turbo sounds pretty bland except for the whistle underfull boost subjectively id rate the vw vr engine as being far moremusical than the turbo also audis own v is also far more musicalwith a rorty race car growl when pressed though none of these canmatch its gruntthe only hint of the engines true capacity occurs when one is takingoff from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop with the extrainertia from the permanently engaged wd system one has to be somewhatdelicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall alternately one could use more revs in both cases a very small priceto pay for such a fantastic engine i think that audi of america shouldoffer an automatic option for this car just as they offer though inextremely small numbers a speed for the much peakier v thecharacteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic ironicallyin europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of theslush marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again chassisive noticed that audis tend to have very wide wheels and relativelymodest tire widths the car comes with firestones of size zrwhich is not uncommon at all however the very attractive spokewheels are no less than inches wide so there is no sidewall bulgewhatsoever combined with the flared wheel arches the s has a mouthwatering macho yet subdued look on rough concrete it becomes immediately clear that the new bodystyle has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well asroad noise suppression i suppose the two are interrelated but idigress to use a cliche the ss body feels like it has been carvedout of stone flex is totally undetectable even when going over roughroads with a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampersdo not cause excessive harshness and while the ss ride quality willnever worry a lexus it will also not draw comparisons to trucks orpony carsthe servotronic steering has already been mentioned i consider it tobe inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering i wasable to test the cars cornering powers without too much trepidation ithink a new concept is at work in this car with its fat gumball tirestalking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless on abanked highway on ramp i went in slow and started applying power as iwent around i could feel the g forces build to the point where theskin on my face was being tugged sideways yet the car was totally andcompletely obedient to throttle and steering inputs it felt that thelimits were not even close to being approached the g forces werethrilling but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangelyuninvolving you tell the car what you want and it does it end ofstory i think that i am starting to relate more and more to thosereviewers who were highly impressed by the honda nsxs clinicalefficiency but were unable to fall in love with the carthe brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car prettywell too though ive read that they are prone to fade i am not toosurprised since the s does not have uprated brakes over the base audi fwd harder pads would help but that in turn would lead to a morewooden response when cold i am starting to see a trend among theluxurysports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset byadditional braking capacity the lss fade performance is nothing tobrag about neither is the qs or the legends brake fade these daysseem to be a forgotten virtue when everybodys attention is focused onantilock capability comfortfor a car with such sporty abilities its comfort levels are alsoexcellent the cabin is beautifully appointed with carbonfiber panelinserts in place of the wood trim of the s all the expectedgizmos are there heated seats power seats seat memory power thisand that the glaring ommision was the trip computer which was removedbecause audi hasnt gotten it to work reliably yet that means that thecar has no boost gauge a real disappointment taking into account howmuch the turbo dominates its performance unusual for the germans the s comes with a honda style moonroof aswell as the very intelligent dialasunroofposition rotary switchnoise levels including engine and tire noise is so low that i wouldntconsider the lexus advantage in this area to be significant enoughto sway a potential buyer conclusioneven though few will be able to afford an audi s at its sticker priceof k the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has tooffer over the competition the valve turbo is a real gem even ifit doesnt produce ferrari sounds no other luxurysports sedan makeroffers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive which to some isworth the extra money all by itself

tranmissionsince the car was bought new while shifting from nd to rd unless i do it slowly and carefully it makes a popping or hitting soundthe dealer and mitsubishi customer service reached by an say this is normal for the car is itand about a year ago at kmiles the stick shift handle got stuckwhile attempting to put it in reverse the shifter would not budge the clutch had no effect the front tires would not budge even when the clutch is fully depressed if the clutch is released the engine would die assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was stuck i could not make the car move it acted as if it were in neutralexcept for dying when clutch is released i finally was able to release the shifter by having someone rock the car back and forth less than an inch while i depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter the shifter acted normally after thatwhen this happened i took it to the dealer they checked the clutch it was ok they checked the transmission it was oki had the exact problem a couple of months ago and again lastweek the dealer says there is nothing they can do because mitsubishi the says they have never heard of theproblem and the dealer could not reproduce the problem whilethey had the car in all three occurances the car was parked head first in a garageand since the front wheels were stuck the car could not be towedto the dealer before releasing the shifter hence temporarilysolving the problem and the dealer and mitsubishi refused tosend someone to check the car while it was stuck i know there is smething wrong with the transmission shifting from nd to rd and getting stuck at random but i cant get the dealer to fix it i need your help with the mechanical problems and with how to handle mitsubishi all hints and suggestions are

if a identical car had the cd reduced from to its pretty complex and cd isnt the whole story either cd for cars isusually calculated based on the frontal area of the car so a large carwith a good cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with apoorer cd to calculate drag use this formulad rho v cd swhere d is the drag force lbs rho is the local air density slugsftv is the velocity fts and s is the frontal area ft note that thepieces called rho v are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressurea fancy aero term for air pressure or force note that power isp f vwhere p is power lbffts f is the force drag in this case lbf and vis velocity fts note that if you put the whole equation into one by substituting d forforce you get a velocity cubed term thats why huge increases in powerresult in little increases in speed ditto for decreases in cd so if you have a mph car and reduce cd from to your new topspeed is sound of trumpet fanfare mphsorry to dissappoint al bowers dod alfa ducati

require it after every miles i am talking about an oil change just a query do you drive your car very very carefully like no sudden acceleration etc if yeah then the m oil change seems quite reasonable but if you drive kinda fast id get a bit up tight abot that thingy a point to note just because the first light came on at k doesnt mean all the others will come on every k too shazshazhmm but the service indicators that i have works this way there are green yellow red indicators initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start your car the computer will actually sense how you drive your car and as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go on and you should get service when by the time green indicators are off after service the mechanicor you will reset the service indicators and the computer starts counting againso i expect to have a toolor a procedure to reset it so the green lights will come on and the yellow and red lights will go offi wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset theindicatorits the first european car i have and changing oil at miles is a surprise to me and its a big plus but i wonder how that could happensince the oil lose its lubrication ability over time i thought its the oil andnot the vehicle

alarm installed its a viper and has a shock sensor sensors for each door ignition cutoff and automatic door locksi have this same alarm installed in my syclone it works great the shocksensor is very sensitive but much more practical than the motion sensor i haveon my other car it doesnt trigger if the car is rocked gently by the windbut any kind of shock sets it off even kicking the tire sets it off itworks great what worries me is the hood and hatch if someone could pry them up gently enough then they could bypass the alarmthe shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it you can adjustit to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood withoutsetting off the alarm although i know that you cannot pop the hood on thesyclone without setting off my alarm now and yet i have had zero none falsealarms with this system the alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it hasbeen activated in your absence i have been able to trace every alarm to itscause and it was not a false alarm im also wondering how easy it would be for a thief to crawl underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the alarm i guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle my syclone is so tightin the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this there aresupplemental power supplies you can put on with this viper alarm but i donthave one i really think that if someone wants my car that bad the alarmwont keep them from it even with a supplemental power supply viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that supposedly detects people approcahing the car this is primarily for convertibles i have a convertible and have looked atthis feature in detail alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you wantto get one of these it has zones in it that can be shut down independently sothat if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else thatwould trigger an alarm it shuts down the zone or rather pulls it in tighteri dont see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that youleave the top down onavoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package it talks topeople as they walk by i saw one installed on a lotus esprit the kids wouldtaunt it seeing how close they could get before it warned them to get back the owner finally disabled it which defeats the purpose in my mind im interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems and about the viper in general i am real happy with my viper one other feature i really like is you can tuneit to your preferences you can have it arm passively or not you can disablethe chirp for armingdisarming you can have it lockunlock the doors when thealarm is armeddisarmed i like these features i hate the chirp when the alarm armsdisarms so mineflashes the lights only i like the door lock feature although i have to becareful to take my keys with me because it doesnt know if you have left yourkeys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors but if you aremeticulous about taking your keys with you it takes care of the rest the car is an ford probe gt that used to be in great shape ron garnett i looked seriously at the alpine system too it is a real nice system butmore money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor the shock sensor is betterand the viper shock sensor is better cyclethan the optional alpine one imho i think the viper gives you a lot of goodvalue for the money but it isnt absolutely tamperproof no system is except maybe the one that james bond had on his lotus in for your

re service indicator of a bmwdchanciscocom derek chan writes in article aprwestminsteracuk jkjecwestminsteracuk shazad barlas writes derek there is a tool available to reset the service indicator on bmws but the lights will come back on after weeks the tool is in fact illegal in europe atleast it is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a used bmw and a few weeks later all the lights come on other than that i know of no other tool anyone else shaz hmm but the service indicators that i have works this way there are green yellow red indicators initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start your car the computer will actually sense how you drive your car and as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go on and you should get service when by the time green indicators are off after service the mechanicor you will reset the service indicators and the computer starts counting again so i expect to have a toolor a procedure to reset it so the green lights will come on and the yellow and red lights will go off i wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the indicator its the first european car i have and changing oil at miles is a surprise to me and its a big plus but i wonder how that could happen since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time i thought its the oil and not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil any bmw owner on the net response welcomed ps my initial question is how do you seset the service indicator of a bmw derek there is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the bimmer service lightsit will cost you from a mailorder and buying one far outweighsthe possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you trydi it yourself you wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it resetwhy is reseting so important the only reason for doingit is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you forget this in european cars you only need to change the oil every crap anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape andextending its life will change it every inc filter dont waitfor the servive lights to come on before servicing the car i bought a bmw about months ago it had green lights on i have changedthe oil every completly flushed brake fliud changed all filtersoilair and fuel changed transmission and drive oilsand done almost all of the other things req for service and a service after nearly miles i

wouldexpect it to be worked out on newer ones in any case it is a warranteerepair or they get the keys backfrom what ive heard it sounds like fordmazda had some qc problems with the probe and probably

radarspeed measurement works a high frequency microwave x band approx ghz and k is approx ghz is sent out and reflected back to theantenna off of an automobile or other objects if an object is movinga doppler shift about hz per mph on x band occurs is measuredand converted to miles per hour these waves bounce all over theplace and they can reflect many times and go in many directionsfrom what i understand the valentine can only tell if thesemicrowaves are coming from the front rear or both there are onlytwo antennas if they are coming from both this in interpreted as aside bogey bogey counts are determined as sources by theirrelative strength to one another even if they are reflections of thesame sourceim certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basison which to make this argument but dont you answer your ownquestion is the reflected signal shifted at all from theact of being reflected if so wouldnt it then be easy forthe detector to discriminate between reflections and directsourceshere is the problem since the microwaves reflect how does the unittell if it is a source or a reflection take a valentine anddrive to the local grocery store that uses an xband radar dooropener you can tell by the small black box above the door pointeddown at about a degree angle and your detector going off when itgets near the valentine will count or bogeys from alldirections

read in a magazine comparing the year ownership costsof a toyota camry and a ford taurus or something like that the resultwhich they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at theend of the period that was their argument to prove that you dont gowrong buying the ford taurus over the camrynow if i remember correctly the camry costs about or so morein initial costs essentially it means that you spend about extraon repairs on the taurus that is ridiculous every time your carneeds repairs it is extra hassles loss of time and a dozen other thingsi would much rather spend more in initial costs than spend morein repair costsdid you account for depreciation i seriously doubt that a tauruswould rack up an extra in repair costs over yearsteddyfrom aaspocwruedu andrew a

saywhat type of response you are having to prednisone since you did not sayhow long you have been on it patients are generally kept on steroids formonths before thinking about tapering alternatives to daily dosing are every other day dosing in your case mg every other day would be a startanother option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to startazathioprine like spenser said you should generally be on another drugin addition to your prednisone like asulfidine a lot of the specificsabout options though depends on severity location and duration of disease as well as histology

march every year any significance to this why does this recur me and my family go through severe pain when our little boy have to undergo surgery why does surgery not rectify the situation also which hospital in us or canada specialize in this malady what will be a good book explaining this disease in detail will keeping a particular diet keep down the probability of recurrence as time goes on will the probability of recurrence go down considering he is getting stronger and healthier and probably less prone to attacks or is this assumption wrong any help throwing light on these queries will

migraine was re sinus endoscopyi noticed several years ago that when i took analgesics fairly regularlymotrin at the time i seemed to get a lot of migraines but hadforgotten about that until i started reading some of the posts herei generally dont take nsaids or tylenol for headaches because ivefound them to be ineffective however i have two other pain sourcesthat force me to take nsaids currently naprosyn first is somepelvic pain that i get at the beginning of my period and then muchworse at midcycle i have had surgery for endometriosis in the past years ago so the drs tell me that my pain is probably dueto the endometriosis coming back ive tried synarel it reducedthe pain while i took it mos but the pain returned immediatelyafter i stopped three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as theonly real solution to my problem although i dont expect to haveany more children i dont like the idea of having my uterus andone remaining ovary removed the first ovary was removed when i hadthe surgery for endometriosis one of the drs that suggestedi get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery but perhaps thinksthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still planto have children so basically all im left with is toughing outthe pain this would be impossible without naprosyn or somethingsimilar but not aspirin that doesnt work and motrin gave mehorrible gastritis a few years ago so im through with it infact naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if i takeit regularly as i did when i had severe back pain and pain in both legs as ill discuss in a moment generally though i wait untili have the pain before i take the naprosyn but then it takesseveral hours for it reduce the pain its actually quite effectiveat reducing the pain it just takes quite a while in the meantimeim frequently in severe painthe other pain source i have is chronic lower back pain resulting inbilateral radiculopathy ive had mris xrays ct scan and emgsive had of them and dont intend to ever do that again withnerve conduction tests the tests have not been conclusive as towhat is causing my back and leg pain the mri reports both say i haveseveral bulging degeneratig disks and from the xrays and mri i thinkit is apparent that i have arthritis the reading on the ct scanwas that there are two herniations ll and ll but othershav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniationsthe second emg and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervationcompared to the first emg oh yeah i had some other horrible testcalled something like somatic evoked response which showed that theinternal nerves are working fine anyway the bottom line is thati sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain the back painis there all the time but i can live with it when the leg pain is therei need some analgesicantiinflammatory medication to reduce the painto a level where i can work so i took naprosyn regulary for months every time i tried to stop the leg pain got worse so id always resume since last november i have taken it much less frequentlyand primarily for the pelvic pain i have been going to physicaltherapy for the last months times a week after the first monthor so my therapist put me on pelvic traction she had tried it earlierbut it had caused a lot of pain in my back this time she tried it ata lower weight after a month or two the pain in my legs began goingaway but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back whichcould be reduced with ultrasound and massage so now i dont havenearly as much pain in my legs in fact my therapist took me offtraction about weeks agogetting back to my original reason for this post even if i can avoidtaking analgesic for headaches i really cant avoid them entirely becausei have other pain sources that force me to use them oh i forgotto mention that it has been suggested to me that i have back surgerybut im avoiding that too i find the migraines difficult to deal withoccassionally i have to take off work but usually i can work but ata reduced capacity im a systems engineer and do a lot of readingand writing when the pelvic pain is bad i cant concentrate muchi usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes becausethe pain is so bothersome when the pain in my back is bad it cancause severe burning in both legs shooting pains in my legs electricshock type of pain in my feet and toes and basically when it gets badi cant really sit at all then i end up spending most of my time homeand in bed so even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines themigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources i get a lotof migraines an average of to a month which last daysive taken cafergot the first time the caffiene really got to me soi reduced the dosage but i dont like the side effects if i takemore than two i get diahrea if i get a very bad headache i willeventually take the cafergot my neurologist wasnt very helpful wheni told him my problems with cafergot he said that when sumatriptanbecomes available i should try that ive tried several other medicationsfiornal midrin fiornal with codeine tegretol and inderal butthey either didnt work or i couldnt tolerate them so what can i domy doctors seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate thepain which i agree with most of the time but not when i have a lot ofpain ive had some bad experiences with surgery my heart stoppedonce from the anesthesia i was told that it was likely thesuccinylcholine and ive already had surgery several timesanyway the point of what im saying is that even if

little buggers over the past six yearssince we moved to nc here are some observations gained frompainful experience reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person some people get tiny red bites others like me are more sensitive and get fairly large swollen sorelike affairs chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving i swear that these things will itch for months there is a lot of folklore about chiggers i think most of it is fiction i have tried to do research on the critters since they have such an effect on me the only book i could find on the subject was a single book in uncs special collections library i have not yet gone through what is required to get it based on my experience and that of my family members the old folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesnt work i recall reading that the theory upon which it is based that the chiggers burrow into your skin and continue to party there is false i think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some sort the little pests release but this is speculation the best approach is prevention a couple of things work well a good insect repellent deet such as deep woods off liberally applied to ankles waistband etc is a good start there is another preparation called chig away that is a combination of sulfur and some kind of cream cortisone that originally was prepared for the army and is not commercially available in the summer i put this on my ankles every morning when i get up on weekends since i literally cant go outside where we live in the country without serious consequences they apparently dont like sulfur much at all you can use sulfur as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them no amount of prevention will be completely successful forget the fingernail polish i have finally settled upon a treatment that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone creme reduces the inflamation and swelling and benzocaine relieves the itch i wont tell you all the things ive tried nor will i tell you some of the things my wife does since this counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned i also think it gains nothing the swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved by the application of hot packs and this seems to speed recovery as welldoctors seem not to care much about chiggers the urban and suburbandoctors apparently dont encounter them much and the rural doctorsseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure isuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggerswould make a lot of money gary h

responsible the insert is a legal document to sloughliability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was tohappen if patients want to have the most useful and reliable informationon a

remedies a rd opinion some of these remedies also work against aids disclaimer this list was compiled from unorthodox sources that have shown themselves to be reliable the compiler of this list is not a doctor of any kind but is exercising his first amendment constitutional right of free speech on the subjects of his choice most of these remedies can be found in any grocery store most of the rest of them can be found in any health food store what is important is how they are used and what else is excluded during their use the day fast st day eat as much fresh fruit as you want one kind at a time preferably grapes nd day eat all the vegetables you want at least half raw including garlic also whole kernel corn to help scrape clean the intestinal linings rd day drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice you want preferably start with to ounces of prune juice with pulp followed by a gallon of pure not from concentrate apple juice then grape juice stay close to your home bathroom th day eat all the unsalted nuts no peanuts and dried fruit you want preferably raisins and almonds almonds contain laetrile th day one gallon of lemonade squeeze the juice from two lemons into a gallon of water preferably distilled and add to tablespoons of locallymade honey no sugar drink one glass per hour everyone including healthy people should do this one day every week preceded by a large glass of prune juice with pulp th day same as th day th day same as th day all days eat only the foods listed above for each day along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements plus as much distilled water as you want the grape diet eat to ounces of fresh grapes every hours am to pm every day for six days eat nothing else during the six days but drink as much distilled water as you want apple cider vinegar mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar not apple cider flavored vinegar regular vinegar is harmful in a glass of water preferably distilled and drink all of it do this or times per

minutes while exercising your fingers toes and limbs turning sideways and onto your stomach dunking your head sitting up and laying back down chomping your teeth together etc among other things the

and drain it for at least minutes after taking the bath stay away from and even out of sight of other people your greatly expanded aura energyfield during that time could disrupt other peoples fields two hours after the bath eat at least ounces of yogurt containing active yogurt cultures the bath may kill friendly bacteria also better yet take a billionbacteria acidophilus capsule which is also an excellent daily remedy against the effects of aids because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the digestive tract taking a big load off the remaining immune system because this external bath can kill internal bacteria it may also be a cure for lyme disease do not take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder storm within days of a full moon nor during major or minor periods as listed in the solunar tables published bimonthly in field stream magazine because of the measurable disruptive ambient environmental energyfields present at those times do not take this bath more than four times per year miscellaneous natural anticancer remedies for skin cancer apply stabilized aloe vera jel to the affected skin twice daily and take to tablespoons per day of stabilized aloe vera

every day to help cure cancer eat several ounces of almonds per day never take large concentrated doses of laetrile orally it will kill you take it intravenously only cancer cells contain a certain enzyme which converts laetrile into cyanide which then kills the cell this enzyme is also present in the digestive system antioxidants are freeradical scavengers and include vitamin e selenium mcg per

prevent them and also prevent and cure many other medical problems including heart diseases they are not too simple and inexpensive to work effectively besides acting on a person biologically and chemically these remedies especially the day fast and the grape diet send a strong message to ones subconscious mind programming it to cure the cancer in my opinion if a person finds out that she has

about some sortof fungus which supposedly attacks the bone structure and is somewhatwidespread in california anybody hear anything about this onethe only fungus i know of from california is coccidiomycosis ihadnt heard that it attacked bone it attacks lung and if youare especially unlucky the central nervous system nothing newabout it its been around for years they call it valleyfever since it is found in the inland valleys not on the coastthere is a miniepidemic of coccidiodes that is occurring ini believe the owens valley bishop area east of the sierrasi dont believe there has

shelleyfrom lindaenetcomcomsubject re morbus meniere is there a real remedyin article pittuucp gebcspittedu gordon banks writesin article lindaecjglkfxmnetcomcom lindaenetcomcom writesmy biggest resentment is the doctor who makes it seem like mostpeople with dizziness can be cured thats definitely not thecase in most cases like i said above it is a long tediousprocess that may or may not end up in a partial cure be sure to say chronic dizziness not just dizziness mostpatients with acute or subacute dizziness will get betterthe vertiginous spells of menieres will also eventually goaway however the patient is left with a deaf earall true and all good pointsto anyone suffering with vertigo dizziness or any variationthereof my best advice to you as a fellowsufferer is thisjust keep searchingdont let the doctors tell you theresnothing that can be donedo your own researchand let yourthis may have helped you but im not sure it is good generaladvice the odds that you are going to find some miracle withyour own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledgefor this or any other disease are slim when good answers to thesethen spending a great deal of time and energy on the medicalproblem may divert that energy from more productive thingsin life a limited amount should be spent to assure yourselfthat your doctor gave you the correct story but after it becomesclear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicinehas no good solution perhaps the best strategy is to jointhe support group and keep abreast of new findings but not tomake a career out of itwell making a career out of it is a bit strong i still believethat doing your own research is very very necessary i wouldnot have progressed as much as i have today unless i had spentthe many hours in stanfords med library as i have doneand years ago it was clear that there was no medicine that would help me so should i have stopped searching thankgoodness i didnt now i found that there is indeed medicinethat helps me i think that what youve said is kind of idealistic that youwould go to one doctor get a diagnosis maybe get a secondopinion and then move on with your lifejust as an example having seen of the top specialists in this field in the country i have received different diagnosesthese are the top names the ones that people come to from all overthe country i have had to sort all of this out myself goingto a support group and in fact heading that support group was helpful for a while but after a point i found it veryunproductive it was much more productive to do library researchmake phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myselfa recent movie lorenzos oil offers a perfect example of whatim talking about if you havent seen it you should its nota put down of doctors and neither is what im saying doctors areonly human and can only do so much but there are those of usout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missingpiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticedi guess im biased because dizziness is one of those weird thingsthat is still so unknown if i had a broken arm or a weak heartor failing kidneys i might not have the same opinion thats because those things are much more tangible and have much more concise definitions and treatments with dizziness you just have todecide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying tofind your way out of iti have chosen the latterlindalindaenetcomnetcomcom gordon banks njxp skepticism is the chastity of the intellect andgebcadredslpittedu it is shameful to

easily to that number eithermanually or automatically while these are a very basic tool they are very useful if youare writing reading driving or doing anything away froma computer which can still cause or aggravate rsi the greatadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever youare doing commentsmy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led tomy writing a lot more and still reading as much as ever whichactually aggravated the rsi in my right arm though the leftarm improved getting a countdown timer watch has beenvery useful on some occasions where i write a lot in

to change your keyboard mappingso you can type onehandedly or with a different twohanded layout onehanded typing tools may help but be very careful about how you use them if you keep the same overall

ladyuhunixuhcchawaiiedu lee ladysubject re science and methodology was homeopathy traditionin article lsjgninnlcsaltillocsutexasedu turpincsutexasedu russell turpin writesi wrote or to use a phrasing that i think is more accurate science is the investigation of phenomena that avoids methods and reasoning that are known to be erroneous from past foulups in article ciuhbnbunyipccuqozau bdpsychpsyuqozau writes i can agree with this if you are talking about the less fundamental aspects of scientific method in fact i dont see the alternative as i dont think that the fundamentals are capable of experimental investigation in saying this i am agreeing with the work of people like kuhn feyerabend and lakatos while methodology cannot be subject to the same kind of experimentalinvestigation as that to which it is applied it can be criticallyappraised methodologies can be compared to each other sometimes bythe conflicting results they produce this kind of critical appraisaland comparison together with the inappropriateness of existingmethodologies for new fields of study is what drives the evolution ofmethodologies and how we think about them as usual you are missing the whole point russell because you are notwilling to even consider questionning your basic article of faith whichis that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highestpurpose of science is to avoid making mistakes this is like saying that the most important aspect of business managementis accurate bookkeeping if science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes itwould be a poor thing indeed what was the methodology of darwin whatwas the methodology of einstein what was for that matter themethodology of jenner and pasteur in an earlier article russell turpin writes none of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we shouldopen the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedosciencemodern advocates of homeopathy chiropracty and traditionalchinese medicine receive little respect because for the mostpart they use methods and reasoning that the kind of researchlee lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty this doesnot imply that all their treatments are ineffective it doesimply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning areincapable of discovering which treatments are effective andwhich are notfirst of all i think you are arguing against a straw man because idont think that anyone here is arguing that quackery pseudosciencehomeopathy chiropracty and traditional chinese medicine should beaccepted as science i in particular think the basic ideas ofhomeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky what some of us do believe however is that some of these thingsincluding some of the flaky ideas are deserving of serious scientificattention if in fact it were true as you have stated above that those who do notuse the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what iseffective and what is not then science today would not exist for allof current science is based on the past work of scientists whosemethodology by current standards was seriously flawed it is certainly true that as methodology improves we need to reexaminethose results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies it isalso true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on those early methodologies needs to be reexamined in a more rigorous fashion by those qualified to do so credibly but to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate doubleblind studies iscapable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that noideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possiblybe worthy of serious investigation this truly marks ones attitude asdoctrinaire

then problems come in two main types local conditions and diffuseconditions local problems are what youd expect specific musclestendons tendon sheaths nerves etc being inflamed or otherwise hurtdiffuse conditions often mistaken for local problems can involve musclediscomfort pain burning andor tingling with identifiable areas oftenderness in muscles although theyre not necessarily the problem why does occupational overuse syndrome occur heres the theorynormally your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries whichpass among the muscle fibers when you tense a muscle you restrictthe blood flow by the time youre exerting of your full poweryoure completely restricting your blood flowwithout fresh blood your muscles use stored energy until they run outthen they switch to anaerobic without oxygen metabolism which generatesnasty byproducts like lactic acid which cause painonce one muscle hurts all its neighbors tense up perhaps to relieve theload this makes sense for your normal sort of injury but it only makesthings worse with repetitive motion more tension means less blood flowand the cycle continuesanother byproduct of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness fromyour nerves they need blood tooanyway when youre typing too much youre never really giving a changefor the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscles neverrelax enough to let the blood through stress poor posture and poorergonomics only make things worse specific injuries you may have heard ofnote most injuries come in two flavors acute and chronic acuteinjuries are severely painful and noticable chronic conditions haveless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as realtenosynovitis an inflamation of the tendon sheath chronic tenosynovitisoccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent not enough tocause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheaths abilityto lubricate the tendon as a result the tendon sheath thickens getsinflamed and youve got your problemtendonitis an inflammation of a tendon repeated tensing of a tendoncan cause inflamation eventually the fibers of the tendon start separatingand can even break leaving behind debris which induces more friction moreswelling and more pain subacute tendonitis is more common which entailsa dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it gets worsewith repetitive activitycarpal tunnel syndrome the nerves that run through your wrist into yourfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them symptoms includefeeling pins and needles tingling numbness and even loss of sensationcts is often confused for a diffuse conditionadverse mechanical tension also known as neural tension this is wherethe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possiblycompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhereamt can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other oos disorders it is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapyothers for just about every part of your body theres a fancy name fora way to injure it by now you should be getting an idea of how oosconditions occur and why just be careful many inexperienced doctorsmisdiagnose problems as carpal tunnel syndrome when in reality youmay have a completely different problem always get a second opinionbefore somebody does something drastic to you like surgery typing posture ergonomics prevention treatmentthe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reducetension in the muscles and tendons this requires learning how to relaxif youre under a load of stress this is doubly important tune outthe world and breath deep and regular relaxing should become a guidingprinciple in your work every three minutes take a three second breakevery three minutes take a three second break really do it everythree minutes its also helpful to work in comfortable surroundingscalm down and relaxif you cant sleep you really need to focus on this rest sleep andrelaxation are really a big dealthere are all kinds of other treatments of course drugs can reduceinflamation and pain custommolded splints can forcefully prevent badposture surgery can fix some problems exercise can help strengthenyour muscles regular stretching can help prevent injury good postureand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension ice or hotcoldcontrast baths also reduce swelling only your doctor can say whats bestfor you posture here are some basic guidelines i so liked the way this waswritten in the new zealand book that im lifting it almost verbatim fromappendix dwallach let your shoulders relax let your elbows swing free keep your wrists straight pull your chin in to look down dont flop your head forward keep the hollow in the base of your spine try leaning back in the chair dont slouch or slump forward alter your posture from time to time every minutes get up and bend your spine backwardset the seat height first your feet should be flat on the floor there should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the kneesand your thighs should not slope too muchnow draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortableto work at if you are short this may be impossible the beest remedyis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using afootrestnow adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the spacebetween the backrest and the seat pan the backrest should support you inthe hollow of your back so adjust its tilt to give firm support in thisareaif you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time leaningback so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if availablenow i diverge a little from the texta good chair makes a big difference if you dont like your chair gofind a better one you really want adjustments for height back angleback height and maybe even seat tilt most arm rests seem to get inthe way although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable armrests which you can also rotate out of the way you should find a goodstore and play with all these chairs pick one thats right for youin the san francisco bay area i highly recommend just chairs thename says it all keyboard drawers wrist pads and keyboard replacementsthere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right for somepeople wrist pads seem to work wonders however with good posture youshouldnt be resting your wrists on anything you would prefer yourkeyboard to be right there if you drop your arms at your side and thenlift your hands up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your handswhen your elbows are at about degrees of course you want to avoidpronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all costs wrist padsmay or may not help at this you should get somebody else to come andlook at how you work how you sit how you type and how you relax itsoften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders ordeviated handssome argue that the normal flat keyboard is antiquated and poorlydesigned a number of replacements are

lee ladysubject re science and methodologyin article aprsbcssunysbedu mhollowaicsunysbedu michael holloway writesin article cjvggbnewshawaiiedu ladyuhunixuhcchawaiiedu lee lady writesi would also like to point out that most of the arguments about sciencein scimed scipsychology etc are not about cases where people arerejecting scientific argumentevidenceproof they are about cases whereno adequate scientific research has been done in some cases there isquite a bit of evidence but it isnt in a format to fit doctrinaireconceptions of what science is here it is again this indicates confusion between proof and the processof doing science you are making precisely one of the points i wanted to makei fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between theprocess of science and the end result as an end result of science one wants to get results that areobjectively verifiable but there is nothing objective about theprocess of science if good empirical research were done and showed that there is some meritto homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable informationbut it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science thisis where you and i disagree with turpin in order to have science onemust have a theoretical structure that makes sense not a merecollection of empirically validated random hypothesesexperiment and empirical studies are an important part of science butthey are merely the culmination of scientific research the mostimportant part of true scientific methodology is scientific thinking without this one does not have any hypotheses worth testing nohypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough datanor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while youre shaving orlooking out the window at least not unless youve done a lot of reallygood thinking beforehand the difference between a nobel prize level scientist and a mediocrescientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology it depends on the quality of their thinking it really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe thatthey are doing science merely because they are conducting empiricalstudies and it bothers me even more that there are many fields such ascertain parts of psychology where there seems to be no thinking at all but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses and im especially offended by russell turpins repeated assertion thatscience amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes simply avoidingmistakes doesnt get you anywhere in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists

see if it happened againwell we were going along fine and the other morning april she hada bowl of another kellogs frosted kind of cereal fruit loops i amembarrassed to admit that i even bought that junk but every oncein a while so i pour it in her bowl and think oh oh this is thesame kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure ten minutes later she had a full blown seizures this was her first exposureto a sugar coated cereal since the last seizurewhen i mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason forthe seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea nowafter this second episode so similar in nature to the first evenhe is scratching his head once again her eeg looks normal which iunderstand can happen even when a person has a seizureonce again we

discovery stood a prior investigator mitscherlich lookingat the same phenomenon had missed a crucial detail presumably because helacked pasteurs motivation to find something that distinguished racemicacid from tartaric now we say dtartaric acidagain pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomerstartaric acid again not because of some rational conviction but becausehe was

butsmaller and larger cycles occur as well im always afraidthat this method will stop working someday but usuallyi seem to be able to hold the weight gain in checkthis is one reason i have a hard time

long time since anyone has proposed restrictions on where one comes up with ideas in order for them to be considered legitimate hypotheses the point in short is this hypotheses and speculation in

lie in the quality of their empirical methodology it depends on the quality of their thinking it really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies and im especially offended by russell turpins repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes simply avoiding mistakes doesnt get you anywhere i think that lee lady and i are talking at cross purposesabove lady seems concerned with the contrast between greatscience that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocrescience that makes smaller steps in most of this thread i havebeen concerned with the difference between what is science andwhat is not lee lady is correct when she asserts that the difference betweeneinstein and the average postdoc physicist is the quality oftheir thought but what is the difference between einstein and agenius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughtsare scientifically screwy some would give velikovsky orkorzybski as examples if you dont like these choose yourown i say it is the same as the difference between the mediocrephysicist and the mediocre proponent of qi both einstein andthe mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from thecumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrongboth velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed todo this let me approach this from a second direction when one is askedto review a paper for a journal or conference there are manykinds of criticism that one can make one kind of criticism isthat the work is just wrong or misinformed another kind ofcriticism is that the work while technically correct is eithernot important or not interesting the first difference is theone that i have been pointing to the second difference is theone that lee lady seems to be discussing if good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable information but it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science this is where you and i disagree with turpin i have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered scientific what is needed is a test of its theoretical claimsnot just of some of its proposed remedies similarly i suspectthat traditional chinese medicine has many remedies that workwhat it lacks as one example is any experiment that tests thepresence of qi in order to have science one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypothesescertainly a theoretical structure that makes sense is the goalin areas where we do not yet have this i see nothing wrong withforming and testing smaller hypotheses lets face it we cannotalways wait for an einstein to come along and make everythingclear for us sometimes those of us who are not einstein have toplug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can

curiousities they are alarge part of the history of sciencethere are a couple of negative points to make here a theory of qi could conceivably become accepted without directverification of the existence of qi for example quarks are an acceptedpart of the standard model of physics with no direct verification whatwould be needed would be a theory based on qi that predicted medicalreality better than the alternatives the central theoretical claim couldlie forever beyond experiment as long as there was a sufficient body ofexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any otheri wouldnt hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi thoughi dont think that there is even a coherent theory based on it much lessa theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology and itis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of ratherdirectly verifying the existence of qi science has not historically progressed in any sort of

methodology was homeopathy traditionavoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable however it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity and in ordinary life perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder in the extreme case a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house in science we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries usually there is some tradeoff between these two desiderata the search for scope and the search for certainty if th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from newton and leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense since they lacked the concept of a limit and in fact because of the lack of a rigorous foundation they made a number of errors in their use of calculus it was only a hundred years later that weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of newton and leibniz nonetheless what newton and leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made in article aprkestreledu kingreasoningcom dick king writes somebody writes i doubt if einstein used any formal methodology he also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish auniverse in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not einstein played by the rules which demand that hypotheses only be put outthere if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove themthese are not the rules according to many who post to scimed andscipsychology according to these posters if its not supported bycarefully designed controlled studies then its not sciencetaken to the extreme i believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science for one thing an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific tradeunionism where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing i dont in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology nonetheless it is one of the results and although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results i think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment and using less than perfect empirical methodology will ever come with anything worthwhile furthermore the big bucks approach to science promotes what i think isone of the most significant errors in science choosing to investigatequestions because they can be readily handled by the currentlyfashionable methodology or because one can readily get institutionalor corporate sponsorship for them instead of directing attention tothose questions which seem to have fundamental significancefor instance certain questions cannot be easily investigated withstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitativeone could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in manyareas of psychology in my opinion a perusal of many of the papersresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questionsinto a statistical framework gives the lie to russell turpinsassertion that current scientific methods avoid all known errorsi think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others and i think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects ladyuhunixuhcchawaiiedu ladyuhunixbitnetfrom johnfhqileafcom john

polite voice consideringhow angry i felt that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings he toldme that he just doesnt have time to rap with patients and thoughtthat was what i wanted i told him that to assume i was calling torap was insulting and said again that i was just following throughon his orders he responded that he resented the implication that he felt i was making that he was not

mark fulk writes flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common the crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they arent of any use unless they make you do some experiments ive known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they wont admit out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beers simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dna electrophoresis gel of human alu fragments he got very excited hoping that hed seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays the result was a wellconserved or so bp sequencebut why do you characterize this as a flight of fancy or a fantasywhile i am unfamiliar with the scientific context here it appears obviousthat his speculation for lack of a better or more neutral word wasat least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptanceof current theory coupled with his observations it would appear thatsomething quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observationinto that theory or to tailor the theory to cover the observation thisdoes not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight offancy or a fantasy it is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs irrational perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds the main examples i can think of are from modern highenergy physics which is not typical of science as a wholewell i think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word alsoextrascientific etc nor am i prepared to give a general account ofrationality in terms of examples there is some danger of beginning to quibbleover what a surprising experiment is what counts as surprising etcthe same may be said about logical grounds my point is that quite frequentlyperhaps even most frequently the roots of a new theory can be traced topreviously existing theories or even to previously rejected hypotheses ofsome other theory or domain i would offer some rather well known examplessuch as toricellis puy de dome experiment done for the sake of his sea of airhypothesis was this theory and the resulting experimental test surprisingwell given the prior explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly mustbe counted as so was the theory constructed and the experiment designedout of perfectly rational grounds well there was a pretty successful andwell know theory of fluids the analogy to fluids by toricelli is explicitthe novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid but this was quite a noveltyat the time was

assertion read hypothesis as it is the gathering ofempirical observations in order to make an hypothesis what shouldconvince you or not shouldnt be the final product so much as how theproduct was made heres your error there is no observation or hypothesis that is not taintedby theory i have a theory i make observations those observations will bemade with my theory in mind yes absolutely though id make the observation in a more general sense ofall observations are made by human beings and therefore made with variousbiases but here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back once again to equating the business of science with the end result the gizmo producedscience works very well at developing theorieswithin paradigms but is very poor at dealing with paradigm shifts if i develop a novel paradigm that explains homeopathy chinese medicine or spontaneous combustion if the paradigm is useful it will show me the wayto make observations that prove or disprove itmy point isnt so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but how you come about developing itthe paradigm of modern medicine is that the body can be reduced to a set ofessentially mechanical operations wherein disease is seen as malfunctions inthe machinery essentially the old newtonian model of the world it seemslikely that theories based upon this paradigm do not give a complete discription of the universe medicine healing etc indeed we now recognize an important psychological component to healing perhaps youd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part the topicof the philosophy of science is made for them im making them too but ithink that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the business of doing science biomedical research doesnt make any basic assumptions that arent the same as any other discipline of scientificresearch that is that you make empirical observations form an hypothesisand test it modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than the old newtonian model of the world and i doubt that many psychologistswould appreciate being put outside this empirical world view psychologyalso has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending it is also important to distinguish reason from science science may bereasonable but so are many nonscientific methodologies aristotle reasonedthat frogs came from mud by observing one hop out of a puddle oversimplified of course but a good example this is an empirical observation it was then tested though perhaps not by aristotle and eventually found wanting in the meantime some folk will have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life theres nothing at all surprising about this its the way the gathering ofknowledge works there are probably more than a few things in my own discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally offbaseeven idiotic to someone in the future these future people wont have cometo these relevations because they had suddenly gone all zenlike and had a vision in an lsd trip someone will have thought of something new and tested it this is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresentingscience and research cant seem to wrap their minds around science is a creative process what i think of as factual and good research can be totallyturned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories again i think it gets down to defining what you mean by science i oftendont recognize what it is that i do and am involved in in the way scienceis portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities theyportray

doctor but my wife is a nurse and i know a lot of doctors and nurses the point here being that doctors and nurses do not seem to get sick nearly as much as people outside the medical professionthis is a lovely area for anecdotes but i am sure you are on to somethingas a physician i almost never get sick usually when something horrendousis going around i either dont get it at all or get a very mild casewhen i do get really sick it is always something unusualthis was not the situation when i was in medical school particularly onpediatrics i never had younger siblings myself and when i went on thepediatric wards i suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectiouschallenges that my body was not ready for pediatrics for me was three solidmonths of illness and i had a temp of when i took the final exami think what happens is that during training and beyond we are constantlyexposed to new things and we have the usual reactions to them so that lateron when challenged with something it is more likely a reexposure for usso we deal with it well and get a mild illness i dont think it is thatthe immune system is hyped up in any way also dont forget that thehospital flora is very

of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies andpetty hatredsflights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common the crucialthing is not to sit around just having fantasies they arent of any useunless they make you do some experiments ive known a lot of scientistswhose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they wont admitout loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beersthe danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalization can end up being far removed from the actual daytoday of the grunt at thebench yes its great to be involved in a process were i can walk into thelab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of itas long as my advisor doesnt catch me which is easy enough to do but stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review committees and the peer review process in general in todays world thats what determines what science is what gets funded and a damn good thing toflights of fantasy just dont have much chance of producing anything at least not in biomedical research the surest way for a graduate student toruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with fleshing out hisher fantasies than with having the student work on a projectthat actually has a good chance of producing some results mds seem to be particularly prone to this aberrant behavior simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dnaelectrophoresis gel of human alu fragments he got very excited hoping thathed seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryoticgenes this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry outbinding assays the result was a wellconserved or so bp sequencethat occurs about times in the human genome unfortunately forwarrens fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present inso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back intothe genome on the other hand the characteristics of transposons weremuch elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase wasrecognized and the standard method of recognizing human dna was createdother species have different sets of transposons fortunately for mewarren and i used to eat dinner at tgi fridays all the timei have to agree with gary merrills response to this ive read alot of thealu and

she hope she will be with us in the fall to discuss diet and medications however ms jennifer friedman an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient was kind enough to step in on very short notice ms friedman gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup even a bit for men to help us look well and healthy and to minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine and drugs we take we are most grateful to jennifer and thank her for an entertaining eveningannual meetingin addition to welcoming dr teperman the april meeting is also the annual meeting of the chapter this is the official notice of the meeting as required by our bylaws the main purpose of the meeting is to review the past year solicit member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs and to elect members of the board of directors for the coming two year term the nominating committee has prepared the following slate for the board anne liver recipient and don treffeisen robert heart recipient and eulene smith vito kidney recipient and bette suglia kay grenzig liver recipient jan schichtel kidney recipient larry juliano kidney recipient david bekofsky director public education litpthose remaining on the board for another year are robert carroll liver kidney pancreas recipient jerry kidney recipient and jeanne eichhorn ron kidney donor and marie healy peter smith bone marrow recipient patricia ann yankus kidney and pancreas recipient walter ruzak kidney recipientthis may seem to be a big board but many hands make light work and with our various medical uncertainties it is good to have backups for all the jobs on the board therefore in addition to the slate being presented for voting nominations will also be accepted from the floor there is no set number of board members and there is plenty of work in addition brief treasurers and membership reports will be given and the floor will be open for any new business suggestions or comments anyone would like to bring upwe will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the majority of the time with dr tepermanfuture meetingsremember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year may dr

ladyuhunixuhcchawaiiedu lee ladysubject re science and methodology was homeopathy traditionin article lsuqinniasaltillocsutexasedu turpincsutexasedu russell turpin writesi agree with everything that lee lady wrote in her previous post inthis thread gee maybe ive misjudged you russell anyone who agrees with something i say cant be all bad seriously im not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes and i still disagree with your contention that nobody who doesnt use methods deemed scientific can possibly know whats true and whats not deleted material which i agree with back to lee lady these are not the rules according to many who post to scimed and scipsychology according to these posters if its not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then its not sciencethese posters are making the mistake that i have previouslycriticized of adhering to a methodological recipe a carefully rules such as support the hypothesis by a carefully designed andcontrolled study are too narrow to apply to all investigationi think that the requirements for particular reasoning to beconvincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that haveoccurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things toreuse the previous example we know that conclusions fromuncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medicalproblems are notoriously problematic okay so lets see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement thata treatment is useful this is often the best evidence we can hope forfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate supportin this case it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as crediblebut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who arequalified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testingsecondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i come to this dispute about what science is not only as amathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in scipsychology andoccasionally in scimed about nlp neurolinguistic programming muchof the work done to date by nlpers can be better categorized asinformal exploration than as careful scientific research for yearsnow i have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists tojust take a look at it to read a few of the books and watch some ofthe videotapes courtesy of your local university library not forthe purpose of making a definitive judgement but simply to look at thenlp methodology especially the approach to eliciting information fromsubjects and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be ofscientific interest and most especially to be aware of thequestions nlp suggests which might be worthy of scientificinvestigationover and over again the response i get in scipychology is if thishasnt been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empiricalresearch then it cant be of any interest to us to me the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme thereve got tobe controlled studies position is an nlp technique called the fastphobiatrauma curesimple phobias as opposed to agoraphobia may not be the worlds most important psychological disorder but the nice thing about them is that it doesnt take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone is cured of one the nlp phobia cure is a simple visualization which requires less than minutes nlpers claim thatit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory and hence isuseful in treating posttraumatic stress syndrome it is essentiallya variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioraltherapists a subject only needs to be taken through the technique onceor in the case of ptsd once for each traumatic incident theprocess doesnt need to be repeated and the subject doesnt need topractice it over again at homenow to me it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure especially if as nlpers claim the success rate is extremely high take someone with a fear of heights as i used to have take them up to a balcony on the th floor and observe their response spend minutes to have them do the simple visualization send them back up to the balcony and see if things have changed check back with them in a few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting more long term followup is certainly desirable but from a scientific point of view even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance in any case there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years to the best of my knowledge there is no known case where the cure has been reversed after holding for a few weeks my own cure incidentally was donewith a slightly different nlp technique before i learned of the fast phobiatrauma cure ten years later now i enjoy living on the thfloor of my building and having a large balcony the folks over in scipsychology have a hundred and one excuses not tomake this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome studywill be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since theyre not part of thescientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance the fast phobiatrauma cure is over ten years old now and the clinical psychology establishment is still saying we dont have any way of knowing that its effective these academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate as anyone could want of course but they say why should i prove your theory and the burden of proof is on the one making the claim one academic in scipsychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasnt been described in a scientific journal its described in a number of books and ive posted articles in scipsychology describing it in as much detail as im capable of actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but its apparently not acceptable because its adoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journalto me this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it this is the kind of thing i have in mind when i talk about doctrinnaire attitudes about science now maybe i have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you russell if so i apologize in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems

postings remind me that i had read about risks associated with the barbecuing of foods namely that carcinogens are generated is this a valid concern if so is it a function of the smoke or the elevated temperatures is it a function of the cooking elements wood or charcoal vs lava rocks i wish to know more thanks i recall that the issue is that fat on the meat liquifies and thendrips down onto the hot elementswhatever they arethat the extremeheat then catalyzes something in the fat into one or morecarcinogens which then are carried back up onto the meat in the smokethe ol professorfrom mmmcupportalcom mark robert thorsonsubject re barbecued foods and health riskthis reminds me of the last graham kerr cooking show i saw today hesmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot he used a strange techniqueid never seen beforehe took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foilthe tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffeetable ash traymade by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edgesin the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a similarquantity of brown rice he said any rice will do the contents of twoteabags of earl grey tea and a few cloveson top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum baskettype steamer withtwo chicken breasts in it the lid was put on and the whole assemblywent on the stovetop at high heat for or minuteslater he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts what surprisesand concerns me are no wood chips where does the smoke flavor come from about or years ago i remember hearing that carmel color obtained by caramelizing sugar a common coloring and flavoring agent had been found to be carcinogenic i believe they injected it under the skin of rats or something if the results were conclusive caramel color would not be legal in the us yet it is still being used was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what about or years ago i remember earl grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit does anyone know whatever happened with that story if it were carcinogenic earl grey tea could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to do sowrt natural wood smoke ive smoking a duck right now as it happensive noticed that a heavilysmoked food item will have an unpleasant tangytaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recentlystopped flowing i find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chipsgetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking processthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chipsmy theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are lowmolecular weightstuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sortof larger molecule more similar to tar the long barbeque time afterthe initial intensive smoke drives off the lowmolecular weight stuffjust leaving the flavor behind does anyone know if my theory is correcti also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat drippingon the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic for that reason and becauseit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess i only grillnondrippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals i do stuff like thisduck by indirect heat i have a long rectangular weber and i put the coalsat one end and the meat at the other end the fat drops directly on thefloor below the meat and next time i use the barbeque i make the firein that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coalsand yet another reason ive heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is thatsmoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon containsnitrosamines which are carcinogenic im pretty sure this claim actuallyhas some standing dont know about the othersan amusing incident i recall was the duncan hines scandal when it wasdiscovered that the people who make duncan hines cake mix were puttinga lot of ethylene dibromide edb into the cake mix to suppress weevilsthis is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenicthe guy who represented the company in the press conference defendedhimself by saying that the risk from eating duncan hines products every dayfor a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoalbroiled steaks what a great analogy when i first heard that myimmediate reaction

an amino acid and everyone uses smallquantities of it for protein synthesis in the body some people have a diseaseknown as phenylketoneurea and they are missing the enzyme necessary to degrade this

cmvvoworldstdcom rsilverworldstdcom richard silver writessome recent postings remind me that i had read about risks associated with the barbecuing of foods namely that carcinogens are generated is this a valid concern if so is it a function of the smoke or the elevated temperatures is it a function of the cooking elements wood or charcoal vs lava rocks i wish to know more thanks from the tufts university guide to total nutrition stanley gershoff phd dean of tufts university school of nutrition harperperennial isbn the greatest hazard of barbecuing is that the cook will not use enough caution and get burned some people suggest that the barbecuing itself is dangerous because the smoke which is absorbed by the meat contains benzopyrene which in its pure form has been known to cause cancer in laboratory animals however in order to experience the same results people would have to consume unrealistically large quantities of barbecued meat at a timerich young these are not kodaks

thousand times sweeter thansugar some people are concerned about the chemicals that the body produces when it degrades nutrasweet it is thought to form formaldehyde and known tofor methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate substances the real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehydeproduced are high enough to cause significant damage as both are toxic toliving cells all i can say is that i will not consume it in the september issue of the tufts university diet and nutrition letter there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners what follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with nutrasweet reproduced without permission the controversy over aspartame began six years ago in englandwhere a group of researchers found that aspartame marketed underthe tradename nutrasweet appears to stimulate appetite andpresumably the eating of more calories in the long run than ifa person simply consumed sugar when researchers asked a groupof people to drink plain water aspartamesweetened water andsugared water they said that overall they felt hungriest afterdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage the study received widespread media attention and stirred agood deal of concern among the artificialsweetenerusing publichowever its results were questionable at best since the researchersdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite didactually translate into an increase in eating the two do notnecessarily go hand in hand in the years that followed more than a dozen studies examiningthe effect of aspartame on appetite and eating were conductedand after reviewing every one of them the director of thelaboratory of the study of human ingestive behavior at johns hopkinsuniversity barbara rolls phd concluded that consuming aspartamesweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase inthe amount of food eaten afterward one artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causingcancer is aspartame but it most certainly has been blamed for ahost of other ills since its introduction in the governmenthas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causingeverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxietystill years of careful scientific study conducted both before andafter the sweeteners entering the market have failed to confirmthat it can bring about adverse health effects thats why thecenters for disease control the government agency charged withmonitoring public health the american medical associationscouncil on scientific affairs and the food and drug

recognised anywhere in thesense of a disease with diagnostic criteria clear boundariesbetween it and other diseases unique pathologic or physiologicfeatures etc but here goes with what many neurologists agree onpostpolio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron diseaseby clinical examination emg and muscle biopsy the abnormalitiesare mostly chronic due to old polio but there is evidence ofongoing deterioration clinically the patients complain ofdeclining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasksmusculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtlesscontributes to the impaired performance the examination showsmuscle weakness and atrophy the emg shows evidence of olddenervation with reinnervation giant and longduration motor unitaction

thanpatients with old polio who are not complaining of deteriorationboth groups can have the same emg and biopsy findings the reasonfor these acute changes in a chronic disease old polio isunknown possibly spinal motor neurons that have reinnervated hugenumbers of muscle fibers start shedding the load after severalyearsthere are a couple of clinical features that distinguish postpoliosyndrome patients from patients with old polio who denydeterioration the pps patients are more likely to have had severepolio the pps patients are much more likely to complain of painthey also tend to score higher on depression scales ofneuropsychologic testsmy take on this im sure some will disagree after recovery fromsevere polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles tendonsligaments bones and joints that leads to inflammatory andordegenerative conditions affecting these structures the increasingpain superimposed on the chronic but unchanging weakness leadsto progressive impairment of motor performance and adl i amperhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a ppspatient who was not limited in some way by pain i do not believethat pps patients have more rapid deterioration

been reducing the gene pool and defining the status of the eugenized inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the insertedgenes later became transmissible to progeny then they may be able tocrowd out garbage genes this may in the future become possible even ifit does awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefullymean provisions will be made for saving genes

individuals would start outas no different than anyone elses but if we could makephilosopherkings with great bodies and long lives would we or theywant to give them elevated status we could the romans did it with theirkings without the benefits of such eugenics the race eventuallyrealized and dealt with the problems which that caused but for a whileit was a problem orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happento persons genetically altered for more menial tasks but there is nothingnew under the sun we treated slaves the same way for millennia before i see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these problems humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom touse any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time thathasnt stopped the race as a whole yet many are the civilizations whichhave died from inability to adapt to environmental change however alsomany are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their ownpower the ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from thefates of others and have survived by making better choices when theirturns came not that i dont think that this gene altering power couldnt wipe us offthe face of the earth or cause endless suffering nuclear power or globalwarming or whatever could and may still do that too the real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue i personally dont thinkman has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off anybetter than he did the for last few we as eugenists may make it an wemay not if we dont i hope there are reservoirs of garbage people outin some backwater with otherwise long discarded garbage genes which willpull us through i believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the sameman needs

godin their hearts this is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtueneeded to escape the problems consequent to poor choices peoples havedied out for many reasons the societies which failed to accept enoughinput from god to safely use the power they had developed have destroyedthemselves and often others in the process it is selfevident that theones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the spiritto use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakesthus far or else havent had enough power for long enough in summary i would say that the question of

turpin writes not imply that all their treatments are ineffective it doesimply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning areincapable of discovering which treatments are effective andwhich are notto start with no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible sotheres a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in agiven context insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completelyand makes progress impossible expenditure of sufficiently large sumsof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this on the otherhand with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results whicheventually turn out to be false there is a morass of studiescontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying you people callthis science my opinion for what its worth is that one sees boththese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigorappropriate for a particular investigation i dont believe it is ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science my second point though is that highly capable people can often makeextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when usingmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards i think thisis true of many scientists and i think it is true of many who approachtheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientificwithin mathematics i think there are several examples especially beforethe twentieth century one conspicuous case is that of riemann who isfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove later mathematicians did prove them of course i think that for a good scientist empirical investigation is often notso much a matter of determining what is true and whats not as it is a matter of convincing other people people have proposed lots of incompatible definitions of science here but i think the ability to objectively convince others of the validity of ones results is anessential element not that one can necessarily do that at every step of the scientific process but i think that if one is not moving toward that goal then one is not doing sciencewhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does andseems to be very successful at it i think that his judgements are alsoworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth furtherinvestigation in article cbyhdnewshawaiiedu i wrote namely is there really justification for the belief that science is a superior path to truth than nonscientific approaches admittedly my question was not at all well posed a considerableamount of effort in a serious scholarly investigation such as isuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately specific question to try and answer the science i was thinking of in my question is the actual science currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century i certainly wasnt thinking of some idealized science or the mere use of reason and observationone thing i had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whetherin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experiencedpractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies since russell turpin seems to be much more familiar than i am withthe study of scientific methodology perhaps he can tell us if there is any existing

tension out of muscles much like aprofessional shiatsu masseur the powerful motor drives twocounterrotating thumbs that move in oneinch orbits releasing tension in the neck back legs and armspressure point massager a to order or receive a catalog call hours days orfax at notewhen i ordered the massager the item number was different and the pricewas not when i received it i glanced thru the newer catalogenclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one i was quite annoyed to see a difference in price i called them about itand the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers although itlooks and works exactly the same he told me to go ahead and return thefirst one and order the cheaper one using the price difference as areason for return in fact since the newer ones might take a while toship from the factory i received this one in days he told me i could use the one i already have until the new one arrives then return the old one very reasonable peoplei have longterm neck shoulder and back pain if i were a building i would be described as structurally unsound i have stretches and exercises to do that help but the problem never really goes away if for whatever reason i do not exercise for a while illness not enoughtime lazy etc the muscles become quite stiff and painful and thus more prone to further strain even with exercise i sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track which st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for pt the tension in my neck if not released eventually causes a headachesometimes confused with a sinus headache over my left eye when my physical therapist has massaged my neck and the suboccipital muscles in particular the knobby areas near the base of the skull the headache usually eased within a day although it hurts like hell to while it is being massagedi ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what i was wishingsomeone would invent a machine that would massage not vibrate my neck and suboccipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past that i could use by myself no doctor visit or inconvenient pt appts for a week later would be needed to use it i could get up in the middle of the night and use it if necessaryi have been using it for about a week or so now and love it the baseunit is about a x rectangle about high with handles on eachside and it plugs into an average outlet the two metal thumbs are about in diameter and protrude about above the base the thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is nonremovable they are located more toward one end rather than centered see figure below they move in either clockwise or counterclockwise directions depending on which side of the switch is pushed and are very quiet it can be used from eitherside for instance the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neckor the top of the neck depending on which direction you approach it for the neckhead the user varies the amount of pressure used by if laying down allowing all or part of the full weight of the head andor neck to rest on the thumbs the handles can also be used if sitting orstanding applying pressure with the armswrists since my wrists arealso impaired im typing this over an extended period of time and i dont have someone living with me who can apply it laying down works well for mefor my back i sit in a highbacked kitchen chair position the massagerbehind me at whatever point i want massaged and lean back lightly ornot so lightly against it the pressure of leaning back holds it in place if i want to massage the entire spine i simply move it down a few inches whenever i feel like it for my back this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used homemade massager of tennis balls taped together with the balls position against a wall or door them over the spine and move the body up and down against them the tennis balls are better than nothing but difficult to use for very long especially if your quads are not in good shape and my long hair gets painfully in the way if i dont pin it up first as far as im concerned the easier something like this is to use the more likely ill usedo it if there are multiple considerationshassles im more likely to not bother with itnot only has this machine helped with my headaches but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased the first time i used it on mynecksuboccipital muscles however i overdid it and pressed too hardagainst it which resulted in a very tender almost bruised area for afew days i laid off it for about days and applied ice which helped after that i was more gradual about applying pressure at this point the pain in the suboccipital area is now minimal while being massaged i also learned to use very light pressure on my lower back which is the most vulnerable point for meit also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder bladesalthough again it took a few days of massaging just a few minutes ata time to really work it outi highly recommend this product if you have similar problems although icannot vouch for its durability it seems pretty sturdy since ive hadit such a short time i plan to use it not only to ease tension but also to loosen the muscls before exercising and maybe after too i havebeen ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks so this was very timely for methis is the st product ive ordered from this company and only recentlybecame aware of it thru a coworker the catalog states they have beenin business since it contains quite a few

methodology of science ifwe deny that no subsequent reports of experimenters are reliable descriptionsof their real reasons impossible to know much about toricellis thoughts thats too bad if it is so

riskin article cupportalcom mmmcupportalcom mark robert thorson writesthis reminds me of the last graham kerr cooking show i saw today hesmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot he used a strange techniqueid never seen before he took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foilthe tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffeetable ash traymade by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges in the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a similarquantity of brown rice he said any rice will do the contents of twoteabags of earl grey tea and a few cloves on top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum baskettype steamer withtwo chicken breasts in it the lid was put on and the whole assemblywent on the stovetop at high heat for or minutes later he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts what surprisesand concerns me are no wood chips where does the smoke flavor come from about or years ago i remember hearing that carmel color obtained by caramelizing sugar a common coloring and flavoring agent had been found to be carcinogenic i believe they injected it under the skin of rats or something if the results were conclusive caramel color would not be legal in the us yet it is still being used was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what about or years ago i remember earl grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit does anyone know whatever happened with that story if it were carcinogenic earl grey tea could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to do so wrt natural wood smoke ive smoking a duck right now as it happensive noticed that a heavilysmoked food item will have an unpleasant tangytaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recentlystopped flowing i find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chipsgetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking processthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips my theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are lowmolecular weightstuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sortof larger molecule more similar to tar the long barbeque time afterthe initial intensive smoke drives off the lowmolecular weight stuffjust leaving the flavor behind does anyone know if my theory is correct i also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat drippingon the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic for that reason and becauseit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess i only grillnondrippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals i do stuff like thisduck by indirect heat i have a long rectangular weber and i put the coalsat one end and the meat at the other end the fat drops directly on thefloor below the meat and next time i use the barbeque i make the firein that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals and yet another reason ive heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is thatsmoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon containsnitrosamines which are carcinogenic im pretty sure this claim actuallyhas some standing dont know about the others an amusing incident i recall was the duncan hines scandal when it wasdiscovered that the people who make duncan hines cake mix were puttinga lot of ethylene dibromide edb into the cake mix to suppress weevilsthis is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenicthe guy who represented the company in the press conference defendedhimself by saying that the risk from eating duncan hines products every dayfor a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoalbroiled steaks what a great analogy when i first heard that myimmediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit one charcoalbroiled steak would be equivalent to duncansi dont understand the assumption that because something is found tobe carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the us i think thatnaturally occuring substances excluding controlled substances arepretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food food additivesor other consumption its only when the chemists concoct sp aningredient that it falls under fda regulations otherwise if they really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everythinghow in the world do you suppose its legal

called have these effects ever been studied how common are these effects thank you in advance for all replies these effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of newtreatments researchers try to limit this kind of effect by performing studies that are blind in various ways some of theseare o the subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a placebo or the test treatment ie whether they are in the control group or the test group o those administering the treatment do not know which subjects receive a placebo or the test treatment o those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects receive a placebo or the test treatmentobviously at the point at which the data is analyzed one has to differentiate the test group from the control group but the analysisis quasipublic the researcher describes it and presents the data onwhich it is based so that others can verify it it is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects areanimals such as mice there were many cases of skewed results becausethose who performed the study did not blind themselves it is notconsidered so important to make mice more ignorant than they alreadyare though it is

problem is that i have proposed adefinition of science that i intended to be interpreted broadlyand that lee lady has interpreted fairly narrowly my definitionis this science is the investigation of the empirical that avoidsmistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previouswork lee lady writes i dont think that science should be defined in a way that some of the activities that lead to really important science namely thinking and informal exploration are not recognized as scientific work unless one classifies thinking and informal exploration as amistake they fall under my definition i hope no one wouldconsider speculation thinking and informal exploration asunscientific in article cnasfmhnewshawaiiedu ladyuhunixuhcchawaiiedu lee lady writes seriously im not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes here is where i think we are talking at crosspurposes it is notclear to me that the kind of definition i have proposed should betaken as describing what science is mainly about considerfor example a definition of invertebrates as all animals lackinga backbone this fairly tells what is an invertebrate andwhat is not an invertebrate but it hardly tells you whatinvertebrates are all about one can read this definition andstill not know that of all animal species are invertebratesthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form thatsome invertebrate groups such as insects and nematodes areubiquitous in all ecosystems etc in short knowing thedefinition of invertebrates does not tell one what they aremainly aboutthe misunderstanding here is my fault i did not give sufficientcontext for people to understand my proposed definition okay so lets see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that a treatment is useful secondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i agree on both counts as an example of the second it would onlytake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinariansthat a treatment was effective despite a lack of controls as to the first i do not think it is useful to talk aboutabsolute scientific truth i think it is more useful to talkabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and thekinds of evidence in particular fields that in the past haveproven faulty or reliable the latter is obviously a matter ofdegree and in each field practitioners try to discover therelevance of different kinds of evidence one of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea aspsuedoscience is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportionregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claimthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it and thehistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidenceare given more weight than others it is perfectly alright tospeculate i have read quite a few refereed papers thatspeculated left and right but the authors were careful toidentify the notions as speculative to list what little evidencewas presently available for them and to describe how researchcould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or touncover its problems often what distinguishes whether a paperof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which theauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work itis in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail the folks over in scipsychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since theyre not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance i think a lot of scientists steer away from things that deserving or not garner a patina of kookiness whenproponents of some practice see no value in more carefulinvestigation of that practice that sets alarms ringing in manyresearchers minds this is unfortunate because there is undoubtedly someintersection between things that are worth investigating andthings that are advocated by those who seem careless orunreasonable in their advocacy on the other hand i canunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select otherdirections for research as gordon banks has pointed out no onewants to become this generations rhine one academic in scipsychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasnt been described in a scientific journal i think this is absurd actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but its apparently not acceptable because its a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journali wonder why the results were not published in my fielddissertation results are typically summarized in papers that aresubmitted to journals often the papers are accepted forpublication before the dissertation is finished this certainlyeases ones defensefinally i hope lee lady will forgive me from commenting eitheron nlp or the discussion of it in

are pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food food additives or other consumption its only when the chemists concoct sp an ingredient that it falls under fda regulations otherwise if they really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything how in the world do you suppose its legal to consume tobacco products which probably should be bannedno there is something called the delany amendment which makes carcinogenicfood additives illegal in any amount this was passed by congress in thes before stuff like mass spectrometry became available which increaseddetectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitudethis is why things like cyclamates and red were banned they are veryweakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats so under the act they arebannedthis also applies to natural carcinogens some of you might remember atime back in the s when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so goodand never tasted so good again that was the time when safrole was bannedthis is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leavesif it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days someonewould do it in order to make money the fact that no one does it indicatesthat enforcement is still in effectan odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as gumbo filethis is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras

useful overview of alternative health therapies the russian engineer semyon kirlian and his wife valentina during the s using alternating currents of high frequency to illuminate their subjects they photographed them they found that if an object was a good conductor such as a metal the picture showed only its surface while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner structure of the object even if it were optically opaque they found too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead and living objects dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones were subject to changes the objects life activity was also visible in highly variable colour patterns high frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in the soviet union but only a few people in the west have taken it up seriously professor douglas dean in new york and professor philips at washington university in st louis have produced kirlian photographs and others have been produced in brazil austria and germany using kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around peoples fingers notably around those of healers who are concentrating on healing someone normally blue and white rays emanate from the fingers but when a subject becomes angry or excited the aura turns red and spotty the soviets are now using kirlian photography to diagnose diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method they argue that in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person isnt actually ill but is about to be they claim to be able to foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase but the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by kirlian photography is the phantom effect during high frequency photography of a leaf from which a part had been cut the photograph gave a complete picture of the leaf with the removed part showing up faintly this is extremely important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can see the legs of amputees as if they were still there the important thing about the kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern cant possibly represent a secondary phenomenon or the field would vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished the energy grid contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than the actual object itself kirlian photography has shown how water mentally charged

kirlian photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists john o pehek harry j kyler and david l faust who reported their findings in the october issue of science their conclusion the

continual surgery to remove the growths three year old lindsay has undergone operations thus far since her diagnosis last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her lifetime even though the disease is hardly a household word it has affected the lives of enough people to inspire the formation of the recurrent respiratory papillomatosis foundation a nonprofit

prevention cure and treatmentsince medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to those viruses causing warts they feel a cure would be within reach if money were available

disorder from anyone who might have recently been effected by it from being associated with it or actually having this disorder and help me find out where i can access any medical literature associated with seizures over the internetrecently i had a baby boy born with seizures which occured hoursafter birth he was immediately transferred to a major hospital in bostonand has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his conditionthis has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only inlearning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing withhospitals proceduresetci dont want to go into a lot of detail but his condition was termed quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weightas a normal baby would he was put on the standard anticonvulsion drugsand that did not seem to help out his mri ekg catscans are all normalbut the eegs show alot of seizure activity after many metabolic testsbody structure tests and infectionvirus tests the doctors still do notknow quite what type of siezures he is having although they do have alotof evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms this is wherewe stand right nowif anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as i mentioned up aboveany information relating to this disorder i would sure appreciate hearingfrom you i am not trying to play doctor here but only trying to gatherinformation about it as i know now these particular types of disordersare still not really well understood by the medical community and so imgoing to see nowif somehow the internet can

medicine thereis a book the yeast connection which talks about this illnessthere is no convincing evidence that such a disease existstheres a lot of evidence it just hasnt been adequately gathered andpublished in a way that will convince the diehard melancholic skepticswho quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is usedfor example dr ivker who wrote the book sinus survival always givesbefore any other treatment a systemic antifungal such as nizoral to hisnew patients if theyve been on braodspectrum antibiotics or more timesin the last two years hes kept a record of the results and for over patients found that over of his patients get significant reliefof allergicsinus symptoms of course this is only the beginning for hisprogramin my case as i reported a few weeks ago i was developing the classicsymptoms outlined in the yeast connection i agree it is a poorly written book eg extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc whichi never had before started in november within one week of full dosageof sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared i cannow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes im alsogreatly improved in other areas as wellof course i have allergy symptoms etc i am especially allergic tomolds yeasts etc it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out thatif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have anatural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where youwould have perceptible symptoms also yeast do produce toxins of varioussorts and again you dont have to be a rocket scientist to realize thatsuch toxins can cause problems in some people in my case it was sinussince thats the center of my allergic response of course the question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed i wasfrom over years of antibiotics nutritionallydeficiencies because of thestress of infections and allergies etc can develop excessive yeastcolonization somewhere in the body it is a tough question to answer sincetesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy one almost has totake an empirical approach to diagnosis fortunately sporanox is relativelysafe unlike past antifungals still have to be careful however so theresno reason any longer to withhold sporanox treatment for empirical reasonsbtw some would say to try nystatin unfortunately most yeast grows hyphaetoo deep into tissue for nystatin to have any permanent affect youll finda lot of people who are on nystatin all the timein summary i appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keepmedicine on the right road but methinks that some who hold too firmlyto the party line are academics who havent been in the trenches long enoughactually treating patients if anybody doctors included said to me to myface that there is no evidence of the yeast connection i cannot guaranteetheir safety for their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified asfar as i am concernedjon

cupportalcommmmcupportalcom mark robert thorson writes i dont understand the assumption that because something is found to be carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the us i think thatno there is something called the delany amendment which makes carcinogenicfood additives illegal in any amount this was passed by congress in thes before stuff like mass spectrometry became available which increaseddetectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitudethis is why things like cyclamates and red were banned they are veryweakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats so under the act they arebannedthis also applies to natural carcinogens some of you might remember atime back in the s when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so goodand never tasted so good again that was the time when safrole was bannedthis is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leavesif it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days someonewould do it in order to make money the fact that no one does it indicatesthat enforcement is still in effectan odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as gumbo filethis is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves thisis not only a natural product but a natural product still in its naturalform so maybe thats how they evade delany or maybe a special exemptionwas made to appease powerful louisiana

my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes under one of her arms after the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it over the course of the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain at this time her doctor suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue while attending one of her therapy sessions while her arm was being manipulated some damage occured nerve which caused the level of pain to permanently increase severly controlled by tylenol s and some loss of use of the arm palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement with great persistence on her part the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm this was removed also but the pain in the arm has not decreased the doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed tylenol and soon morphine to relieve the pain she has tried acupuncture by this only provides minor reductions in pain and is only short term my questions are has anyone has heard of similar cases and what if anything was done to reduce the levels of pain are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored any general suggestions on pain reduction would be

aprwalterbellcorecom jchencttbellcorecom writesthe funny thing is the personaly stories about reactions to msg vary sogreatly some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face someclaim their heart skipped beats once in a whileboth of these symptoms are related tachycardia getting a flushedface is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regularpulse i suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels inthe blood since note sodium chloride monosodium glutamate both aresodium compounds our bodies require sodium but like everything elseone can get too much of a good thingsome reacted with headache again this could be related to increased blood flow from increasedheart rate from the sodium in the msg distended crainial arteriesessentially one of many causes of headaches there is no discrepencyher necessarilysome stomach achewell stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related again notnecessarily a discrepency more likely a related reaction vomitingoccurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism haseaten if a person cant digest the stuff entirely possible thelist of stuff people are allergic to is quite long and lacks anenzyme to break it down gastrointestinal distress stomach or bellyache would be expected some had watery eyes or running nosethese are respiratory reactions and are now considered to be similarto vomitting they are a way for the body to dispose of noxiouscompounds they are adaptiove responses of course it is possiblesome other food or environmental compound could be responsible for thesymptoms but its important to remember that a lot opf these effetscan be additive synergystic subtractive etc etc it would benecessary to know exactly what was in a dish and what else the personwas exposed to respiratory does sound suspicious but resopirationand heart rate are connected things in the body are far fromsimplevery inetractive place the vertebrate body somehad itchy skin or rashes people respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound it dependsupon what it is about the compound that pisses off their bodypollen for example of some plants aggrivates breathing in manypeople because when inhaled it sets of the immune system and anhistamine attack is launched the immune system goes overboardcausing the allergic person a lot of misery and someone with anallergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas thatcontain pollens chamomile linden etc drinking the substance canperturb that persons system as much as inhaling it more serious accusations include respiration difficulty see above and dont think that heart rate changes and circulatoryproblems are not serious they can be deadlyand brain damage the area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine systemcontrolling the release of gonadotropin the suprahormone controllingthe cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol as well as somatostatinand other steroids testing for effective dose would be uh a wee bit unethicalnow here is a new one vomiting my guess is that msg becomes the number onesuspect of any problem in this case it might be just foodpoisoning absolutely but it could also be some synergystic mess from eating say undetected shrimp or mushrooms to which many are allergic plustoo much alcohol and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking homeplus lets say having contracted flu from ones sig other daysbefore from drinking out of the same glass could be all sorts ofthingsbut it might be the msg if you heard things about msg you may think it must be itif noone else got sick its likely not food poisoning

the minimal contaminant involved with acupuncture needle insertion most acupuncturists use disposable needlesuse once and throw away they do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of diseases via this routeso its good business to advertise disposable needlesused here these needles tend to be of a lower quality however being poorly manufactured and too sharp in my opinion they tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles if i choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint that patient will get their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments the risk here for hepatitis hiv etc transmission is that i could mistakenly use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong patientbut clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates this risk better quality needles tend to slide past vessels and nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snagsand hematomasso i use them acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknessesbut they are all solid when compared to their injectionstyle cousins in china herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into meridian points purported to have tcm physiologic effects and so require the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine this meansthinkingtinythat a samll amount of tissue the diameter of the needle bore will be injected into the body as it would be in a typical shot when the skin is puntured on the other hand when the solid acupuncture needle is inserted the skin tends to squeeze the needle from the tip to the level of insertion such that any cooties that havent been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion tend to remain on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior of course in tcmthe bodys exterior is protected by the wei protective qiso infection is unlikelyor in other wordsthere is a normal inflammatory and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture sitewhile im fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion i would like to know for what complaint they have consulted

by visitations to laboratories by cdh surveillance staff during the increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at dmhc and in culturepositivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact however the stable culturepositivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory which serves a network of clinics statewide indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population one possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado may be gang and drugrelated sexual behavior as implicated in a recent outbreak of drugresistant gonorrhea and other stds in colorado springs although the high morbidity census tracts in the denver metropolitan area coincide with areas of gang and drug activity this hypothesis requires further assessment to examine the possible role of drug use implicated previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis the cdh stdaids program is collecting information from all persons in whom gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use exchange of sex for money or drugs and gang affiliation the gonorrhea rate for blacks in colorado substantially exceeds the national health objective for the year per objective a race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other stds risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at greatest risk for stds and for targeting prevention efforts moreover racespecific variation in std rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status access to medical care and highrisk behaviors in response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado interventions initiated by the cdh stdaids program include targeting partner notification in the

states and source mmwr date apr motorvehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and young adults in the united states and account for more than million years of potential life lost before age annually child safety seats and safety belts can substantially reduce this loss from through all states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety belts for children although these laws reduce injuries to young children by an estimated motorvehicle crashrelated injuries remain a major cause of disability and death among us children while the use of occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age usage for those aged years aged years and aged years in addition parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to use restraints for their children to characterize the association between adult safetybelt use and adultreported consistent use of occupant restraints for the youngest child aged less than years within a household cdc analyzed data obtained from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system brfss during and this report summarizes the findings from this study data were available for respondents aged greater than or equal to years in states that participated in brfss a populationbased randomdigitdialed telephone survey and administered a standard injury control and child safety module developed by cdc of these respondents had a child aged less than years in their household each respondent was asked to specify the childs age and the frequency of restraint use for that child the two categories of child restraint and adult safetybelt use in this analysis were consistent use ie always buckle up and less than consistent use ie almost always sometimes rarely or never buckle up data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state software for survey data analysis sudaan was used to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals statistically significant differences were defined by p values of less than each of the states had some type of child restraint law of these six arizona kentucky maine nebraska rhode island and west virginia had no law requiring adults to use safety belts four idaho maryland pennsylvania and washington had a secondary enforcement mandatory safetybelt law ie a vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse of

protection hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april laws included all children aged less than years but the other two states used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use the analysis in this report subgrouped states into those having a law requiring adult safetybelt use law states and those without such a law nolaw states overall of children aged less than years reportedly were not consistently restrained during automobile travel both child restraint use and adult restraint use were significantly higher p less than chisquare test in law states than in nolaw states versus and versus respectively high rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than consistent safetybelt use figure adults with consistent use reported high rates of childoccupant restraint use regardless of the childs age range for yearolds to for yearolds in comparison for adults reporting less than consistent safetybelt use the rate of childoccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child range for yearolds to for yearolds when comparing children of consistent adult safetybelt users with children of less than consistent adult safetybelt users confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age groups ie aged less than and year reported childoccupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded that in nolaw states regardless of age of child table in addition higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with increased restraint use for children a factor that has also been associated with increased adult safetybelt use reported by national center for injury prevention and control national center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion cdc editorial note the findings in this report are consistent with others indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to employ occupant restraints for their children because these nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit other risktaking behaviors children traveling with them may be at greater risk for motorvehicle injury educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with child restraint use in this report accordingly occupantprotection programs should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment because low educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status such programs should be offered to adults through healthcare facilities that serve lowincome communities or through federal programs ie head start that are directed at parents with young children injuryprevention programs emphasize restraining young children in addition however efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april they become older parents especially those with low educational attainment those who do not consistently wear safety belts and those from states that do not have mandatory safetybelt use laws should be encouraged to wear safety belts and to protect their children by using approved

regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis fetal alcohol syndrome hip dislocationdysplasia microcephalus obstruction of the kidneyureter and scoliosislordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability however differences in the prevalences of armhand limb reduction encephalocele spina bifida or trisomy down syndrome are probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment because these defects are relatively easy to diagnose interpretation regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalences of trisomy and spina bifida however the reason for differences in armhand reduction is unknown but may be related to variability in environmental exposure heterogeneity in the gene pool or random variation actions taken

epidemiologists and from sentinel family practice physicians nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received throughout the year results during the influenza season influenza ahn and b viruses were identified in the united states with essentially equal frequency overall although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted over the course of the season throughout the season increases in the indices of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza ahn predominated were similar to increases in regions where influenza b predominated only of identified viruses were influenza ahn but isolations of this subtype increased as the season waned and it subsequently predominated during the season during the season outbreaks in nursing homes were reported in association with influenza b and ahn but not influenza ahn interpretation the alternating temporal and geographic predominance of influenza strains ahn and b during the season emphasizes the importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance since amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza a actions taken weekly interim analyses of

reproductive technologiesfollowing the birth of the first in vitro fertilizationembryo transfer ivfet baby in a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been developed that include ivfet gamete intrafallopian tube transfer gift embryo cryopreservation freezing and gamete micromanipulation together these technologies are referred to as the hightech assisted reproductive technology art procedures ovulation induction sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease andor pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility management however when these fail it almost always is appropriate to proceed with one of the art procedures therefore in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility service at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility there is a program of assisted reproduction that specializes in art procedures this program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients in the state of arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the traditional therapies the following article on back describes the art procedures available in our center clarifies appropriate applications for each and considers the realistic expectations for their success procedures included are o in vitro o fertilization embryo transfer ivfet gamete intrafallopian tube transfer o gift cryopreservation of human embryos and gamete micromanipulation this article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed towards improved success of these technologies hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april future areas of researchin addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the management of infertile couples we are developing the technology to assist couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary disease this technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either dna amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization there are recent reports of the successful application of dna amplification by other centers for example for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia we hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probing the x chromosome the identification of which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit sexlinked disorders the considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis in addition to the possibility of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses in order to avoid the birth of affected children catherine racowsky phdassociate professor and director of researchdepartment of obstetrics and gynecologycollege of medicine university of arizonatucson arizona applications success rates and advances for the management of infertilitythe following are the art procedures available at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility in vitro fertilization embryo transfer is the core art procedure of our assisted reproduction program this procedure involves retrieval of unfertilized eggs from the ovary their insemination in vitro in a dish and the culture of resultant embryos for or days before they are transferred to the patients uterus all cultures are maintained in an incubator under strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions before being processed for use in insemination semen samples are evaluated in our andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computerhicnet medical newsletter page volume number april assisted semen analyses to ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to perform ivfet or indeed gift follicular development is typically stimulated with gonadotropins perganol metrodin gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh factrel lutrepulse andor gnrh analogues lupron depo lupron synarel occasionally however ivfet is accomplished with eggs obtained in nonstimulated cycles while some programs utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasoundguided retrieval in our infertility unit with the patient sedated couples who resort to ivfet exhibit such pathologies as tubal deficiencies ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis andor mild forms of male factor infertility according to the united states ivf registry the overall success rate for ivfet nationwide has stabilized at about percent per cycle results from our program involving patients who have undergone ivfet cycles reflect a comparable success rate nevertheless the overall incidence of success with this procedure is disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies well recognized predictors of outcome include patient age response to exogenous ovarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeated ivfet cycle attempts however among these age is the single most significant determinant of conception therefore it is critical that such patients are referred to an assisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity following failure of traditional therapies the underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not been clearly delineated beyond recognition that the number of eggs available for retrieval declines markedly with age fertilization rates significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over years and provided the appropriate hormonal background is present age is unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy ongoing research in our center therefore is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may be impacted by age we have determined that more than percent of eggs that fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal and that a significant proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age currently the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor our program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy gift this hightech art procedure is performed in the operating room usually with the use of a laparoscope and in contrast to ivfet involves introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the fallopian tube an average of eggstube under these circumstances fertilization occurs in vivo and if excess eggs are retrieved the remainder undergo ivf with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle or freezing for transfer in a subsequent cycle this art procedure is applied to cases in hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april which there is at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple has such pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis male factor infertility andor idiopathic infertility the data reported in the united states ivf registry for through indicate that the overall success rate with gift is higher than that obtained with the ivfet technique range of clinical pregnancies for gift is to percent and for ivfet to percent in view of this fact one might expect more patients to be treated with gift than ivfet however in our program we have taken into account three basic concerns which while substantially reducing the number of gift cycles performed benefit the patient these concerns are the increased costs associated with performing a procedure in the operating room the risks albeit minimal of undergoing general anesthesia and the considerable benefits to be accrued from obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs and the developmental competency of resultant embryos the increased success with gift undoubtedly reflects the artificial environment provided by the laboratory in the ivfet procedure between january and december we have performed a total of gift cycles with an overall success rate of percent embryo cryopreservation or freezing is applied in our program when embryos result from residual gift eggs or from nontransferred ivf embryos this procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for success at much reduced costs but also circumvents the legal and ethical issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos therefore as stipulated by the american fertility society ethical guidelines for art programs from both a practical and an ethical standpoint all assisted reproduction programs should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys gamete micromanipulation this art procedure which is still very new is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility less than million spermml in combination with fewer than perccent motile sperm andor less than percent sperm with normal morphology we are currently developing the procedure of subzonal insertion szi which entails injecting sperm under the coating around the egg the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm through enzymatic digestion available data from szi programs worldwide indicate that only to percent of szi cycles result in a pregnancy this statistic undoubtedly relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm therefore we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation such efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to establish conception catherine racowsky

health has announced it will start treating hivpositive patients as soon as possible after seroconversion resulting from recent findings that show hiv is active in the body in large numbers much earlier than was previously believed anthony fauci director of the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid said we must address the question of how to treat people as early as we possibly can with drugs that are safe enough to give people for years and that will get around microbial resistance he said any delay would signify questions over safety and resistance rather than a lack of funds fauci who coauthored one of the two papers published last week in nature rejects the argument by one of his coauthors cecil fox that the new discovery indicates that billion spent on vaccine trials has been a waste of time and money because the trials were started too long after the patients were infected and were ended too quickly john tew of the medical college of virginia in richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument for early treatment of hivinfected patients aids activists welcomed the new information but said the scientific community has been slow to understand the significance of infection of the lymph tissue weve known about this for five years but were glad it is now in the public domain said jesse dobson of the californiabased project inform but peter duesberg who believes that aids is independent of hiv and is a result of drug abuse in the west said we are several paradoxes away from an explanation of aidseven if these papers are right april risk of aids virus from doctors found to be minimal washington post p a the risk of hiv being transmitted from infected healthcare professionals to patients is minimal according to new research published in todays journal of the american medical association jama this finding supports previous conclusions by health experts that the chance of contracting hiv from a health care worker is remote three studies in the jama demonstrate that thousands of patients were treated by two hivpositive surgeons and dentists without becoming infected with the virus the studies were conducted by separate research teams in new hampshire maryland and florida each study started with an hivpositive doctor or dentist and tested all patients willing to participate the new hampshire study found that none of the patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an hivpositive orthopedic surgeon contracted hiv in maryland of patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at johns hopkins hospital were found to be hivnegative similarly in florida of dental hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april patients who all had been treated by an hivpositive general dentist were tested and found to be negative for hiv the florida researchers led by gordon m dickinson of the university of miami school of medicine said this study indicates that the risk for transmission of hiv from a

research program aids treatment news no p gilden dave the new office of alternative medicine at the national institutes of health has raised questions about the nihs commitment to an effort that uses unorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods the oam is a small division of the nih with its budget only at million dollars compared to more than billion for the nih as a whole in addition the money for available research grants is even smaller about to total will be available this year for or grants kaiya montaocean of the center for natural and traditional medicine in washington dc says the oam is afraid to become involved in aids they have to look successful and there is no easy answer in aids she said there is also a common perception that the oam will focus on fields the nih establishment will find nonthreatening such as relaxation techniques and acupuncture when the oam called for an advisory committee conference of about people last year the aids community was largely missing from the meeting in addition activists general lack of contact with the office has added suspicion that the epidemic will be ignored jon greenberg of actupnew york said the oam advisory panel is composed of practitioners without real research experience it will take them several years to accept the nature of research nevertheless dr leanna standish research director and aids investigator at the bastyr

herpesvirus can hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april kill natural killer cells scientists previously knew that the natural killer cells of patients infected with hiv do not work correctly lussos research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack according to anthony l komaroff a researcher with harvard medical school despite the testtube findings scientists are uncertain whether the same result occurs in the body lussos team also found that herpesvirus produces the cd receptor molecule that provides access for hiv cd tlymphocytes express this surface receptor making them vulnerable to hivs attack researchers concluded that herpesvirus cells can exacerbate the affects of hiv april aids

not only ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of certain health problems but also to be committed to related policies write george gellert and dale f nordenberg of the orange county health care agency santa ana calif and the emory university school of public health in atlanta ga respectively dr berkleys editorial on why american doctors should care about the aids epidemic beyond the united states details several reasons for the concerted interest that all countries share in combating aids it should be noted that while aids leads in hastening global health interdependence it is not the only illness doing so diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations berkley mentions the enormous social and economic impact that aids will have on many developing countries and the increased need for international assistance that will result berkley also cites the lack of political aggressiveness toward the aids epidemic in its first decade but now there is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in approach to international health and development in general and hivaids in particular vice president al gore proposes in his book earth in the balance a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable international development with programs to promote literacy improve child survival and disseminate contraceptive technology and access throughout the developing world if enacted this change in policy could drastically change the future of worldwide health aids and priorities in the global village in reply journal of the american hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april medical association vol no p berkley seth every nation should tackle hiv as early and aggressively as possible before the disease reaches an endemic state even at a cost of diverting less attention to some other illnesses writes seth berkley of the rockefeller foundation in new york ny in reply to a letter by drs gellert and nordenberg although it is true that diseases other than aids such as malaria and respiratory and intestinal illnesses have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much more attention than they are getting berkley disagrees with the contention that aids is receiving too much attention hiv differs from other diseases in most developing countries because it is continuing to spread for most endemic diseases the outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another year of about the same level of needless disease and death but with aids and its increasing spread the cost of neglect not only in disease burden but financially is much greater interventions in the early part of a rampantly spreading epidemic like hiv are highly costeffective because each individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission berkley says he agrees with gellert and nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effects of aids and about the need for political leadership but he concludes that not only is assertive political leadership needed in the united states for the aids epidemic but even more so in developing countries with high rates of hiv infection and where complacency about the epidemic has been the

hivinfected but have no symptoms of hiv disease hhs secretary donna e shalala said this initial study can be seen as a hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of hivinfected children who now face the certainty they will develop aids anthony s fauci md director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and of the nih office of aids research said the trial is the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay disease progression in children with hiv who are not yet sick if these vaccines prove to be safe more sophisticated questions about their therapeutic potential will be assessed in phase ii trials the centers for disease control and prevention estimates children in the united states have hiv by the end of the decade the world health organization projects million children will be infected worldwide the study will enroll children ages month to years old niaid which funds the aids clinical trials group network anticipates conducting the trial at nine actg sites around the country and three sites participating in the actg but funded by the national institute of child health and human development preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows that certain vaccines can boost existing hivspecific immune responses and hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april stimulate new ones it will be several years however before researchers know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease the results from the pediatric trial known as actg will be examined closely for other reasons as well this trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate hiv vaccines said daniel hoth md director of niaids division of aids we need this information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent hiv infection in children in the united states most hivinfected children live in poor innercity areas and more than percent are minorities mainly black or hispanic nearly all hivinfected children acquire the virus from their mothers during pregnancy or at birth an infected mother in the united states has more than a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby as growing numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to hiv through injection drug use or infected sexual partners researchers expect a corresponding increase in the numbers of infected children hiv disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults the most recent information suggests that percent of infants born with hiv develop a serious aidsrelated infection by to years of age these infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of childhood that can result in seizures pneumonia diarrhea and other symptoms leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays at least half of the children in the trial will be years of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older participants all volunteers must have welldocumented hiv infection but no symptoms of hiv disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen liver or spleen they cannot have received any antiretroviral or immuneregulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study study chair john s lambert md of the university of rochester medical school and co chair samuel katz md of duke university school of medicine will coordinate the trial assisted by james mcnamara md medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of niaids division of aids we will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children for any side effects to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or fevers for example than another said dr mcnamara well also look at whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other significant laboratory or clinical effects he emphasized that the small study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april products the trial will test two doses each of three experimental

number april new evidence that the hiv can cause disease independently news from the national institute of dental researchthere is new evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus can cause disease independently of its ability to suppress the immune system say scientists at the national institues of health they report that hiv itself not an opportunistic infection caused scaling skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for hiv although the hiv genes were active in the mice they did not compromise the animals immunity the researchers found this led them to conclude that the hiv itself caused the skin disease our findings support a growing body of evidence that hiv can cause disease without affecting the immune system said lead author dr jeffrey kopp of the national institute of dental research nidr dr kopp and his colleagues described their study in the march issue of aids research and human retroviruses developing animal models of hiv infection has been difficult since most animals including mice cannot be infected by the virus to bypass this problem scientists have developed hivtransgenic mice which carry genes for hiv as well as their own genetic material nidr scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting hiv genes into mouse eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice the resulting litters contained both normal and transgenic animals institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of hiv genetic material in l those mice however became sick and died too soon after birth to study in depth in the present study the scientists used an incomplete copy of hiv which allowed the animals to live longer some of the transgenic animals developed scaling wartlike tumors on their necks and backs other transgenic mice developed thickened crusting skin lesions that covered most of their bodies resembling psoriasis in humans no skin lesions developed in their normal nontransgenic littermates studies of tissue taken from the wartlike skin tumors showed that they were a type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma although the papillomavirus can cause these skin lesions laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the animals tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the presence of a proteinproducing molecule made by the hiv genetic material hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april evidence of hiv protein production proved that the viral genes were turned on or active said dr kopp the scientists found no evidence however of compromised immunity in the mice no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common infections the fact that hiv genes were active but the animals immune systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the skin lesions dr kopp said further proof of hiv gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light the light increased hiv genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin papilloma formation in response to increased hiv genetic activity proved the genes were responsible for the skin condition the scientists said no lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the uv light the transgenic mice used in this study were developed at nidr by dr peter dickie who is now with the national institute of allergy and

us department of health and human services march hhs secretary donna e shalala today announced the first nationwide clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care professionals who have questions about providing care to people with hiv infection or aids the tollfree national hiv telephone consulting service is staffed by a physician a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist it provides information on drugs clinical trials and the latest treatment methods the service is funded by the health resources and services administration and operates out of san francisco general hospital secretary shalala said one goal of this project is to share expertise so patients get the best care a second goal is to get more primary health care providers involved in care for people with hiv or aids which reduces treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and community social support networks currently many providers refer patients with hiv or aids to specialists or other providers who have more experience secretary shalala said this clinical expertise should be especially helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with hiv or aids in communities and clinical sites where hiv expertise is not readily available the telephone number for health care professionals is and it is accessible from am to pm est am to pm pst monday through friday during these times consultants will try to answer questions immediately or within an hour at other times physicians and health care providers can leave an electronic message and questions will be answered as quickly as possible health care professionals may call the service to ask any question related to providing hiv care including the latest hivaids drug treatment information clinical trials information subspecialty case referral literature searches and other information the service is designed for health care professionals rather than patients families or others who have alternate sources of information or materials when a health care professional calls the new service the call is taken by either a clinical pharmacist primary care physician or family nurse practitioner all staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and inpatient primary care for people with hivrelated diseases the consultant asks for patientspecific information including cd cell count current medications sex age and the patients hiv history this national service has grown out of a month local effort that hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april responded to nearly calls from health care providers in northern california the initial project was funded by hrsas bureau of health professions through its community provider aids training cpat project and by the american academy of family physicians when providers expand their knowledge they also improve the quality of care they are able to provide to their patients said hrsa administrator robert g harmon md mph this project will be a great resource for health care professionals and the hivaids patients they serve this service has opened a new means of communication between health care professionals and experts on hiv care management said hrsas associate administrator for aids and director of the bureau of health resources development g stephen bowen md mph providers who treat

introduction despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the united states since the early s the us public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes eg escherichia coli oh hepatitis c virus human immunodeficiency virus legionnaires disease lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis tb have increased in many areas furthermore control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal disease salmonellosis shigellosis tb and staphylococcal infections emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons those in institutional settings eg hospitals and child day care centers and minority and underserved populations the substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the us healthcare system could be reduced by more effective surveillance

diseases br div of bacterial and mycotic diseases national center for infectious diseases cdc editorial note e coli oh is a pathogenic gramnegative bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers this pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hus the most common cause of acute renal failure in children outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef although other food vehicles including roast beef raw milk and apple cider also have been implicated preliminary data from a cdc year nationwide multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for e coli oh that organism was isolated more frequently than shigella in four of participating hospitals and was isolated from of all bloody stools a higher rate than for any other pathogen infection with e coli oh often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april smac medium and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection the usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea often bloody and abdominal cramps fever is infrequent younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications illness usually resolves after days but of patients develop hus which is characterized by hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia renal failure and a death rate of this report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of e coli oh in the absence of routine surveillance despite the magnitude of this outbreak the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in washington clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or hus for e coli oh using smac agar when infections with e coli oh are identified they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and if necessary public health action to prevent further cases e coli oh lives in the intestines of healthy cattle and can contaminate meat during slaughter cdc is collaborating with the us department of agricultures food safety inspection service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as e coli oh entering the meat supply because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated the optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink and the juices are clear in this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role the food and drug administration fda has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to f c fda personal communication regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks the public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by e coli oh and for hus to better define the

indicate that the use of smokeless tobacco was highest among young males adolescent and young adult males in particular are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility use of oral snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players encouraging this behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for nicotine addiction oral cancer and other mouth disorders differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among racialethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require further explanation for example targeted marketing practices may play a role in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups and affecting the differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons in this report one concern is that nearly one fourth of current smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes in the nhishpdp the prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users in a previous study among college students of current smokeless tobacco users smoked hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april occasionally in addition approximately of adults who formerly smoked reported substituting

linked to serious asthma attacks american lung association a new study published by the american lung association has shown that surprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with asthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment the seattlebased study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution the actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed unsafe under federal air quality laws people with asthma have inflamed airways and airborne particles tend to exacerbate that inflammation said joel schwartz phd of the environmental protection agency who was the lead author of the study when people are on the threshold of having a serious asthma attack particles can push them over the edge the seattle study correlated months of asthma emergency room visits with daily levels of pm or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of microns or less these finer particles are considered hazardous because they are small enough penetrate into the lung cities are considered out of compliance with clean air laws if the hour average concentration of pm exceeds micrograms per cubic millimeter of air in seattle however a link between fine particles and asthma was found at levels as low as micrograms the authors concluded that for every microgram increase in the fourday average of pm the odds of someone with asthma needing emergency treatment increased by percent the findings were published in the april american review of respiratory disease an official journal of the american thoracic society the lung associations medical section the study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat a study by dr schwartz and douglas dockery phd of harvard found that particles may be causing roughly premature deaths each year in the united states other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms and bronchitis in children government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone says dr schwartz but more and more research is showing that particles are bad actors as well one problem in setting standards for particulate air pollution is that pmio is difficult to study unlike other regulated pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide particulate matter is a complex and varying mixture of substances including carbon hydrocarbons dust and hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april acid aerosols researchers cant put people in exposure chambers to study the effects of particulate air pollution says dr schwartz we have no way of duplicating the typical urban mix of particles consequently most of what is known about particulates has been learned through populationbased research like the seattle study given that the epas current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur dioxide standards the agency is unlikely to reexamine the pm standard any time soon until changes are made there appears to be little people with asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles in some areas you can get reports on air quality but the reports only cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard and thats rarely particulate matter says dr schwartz however pm doesnt have to be near its violation range to be unhealthyhicnet medical newsletter page volume number april nih consensus development conference on melanomathe national institutes of health consensus development conference on

incidence morbidity and mortality within the program there are four types of cancer centers basic science cancer centers which engage primarily in basic cancer research clinical cancer centers which focus on clinical research comprehensive cancer centers which emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research patient care and community outreach and consortium cancer centers which specialize in cancer prevention and control research although some cancer centers existed in the late s and the s it was the national cancer act of that authorized the establishment of new cancer centers as well as continuing support for existing ones the passage of the act also dramatically transformed the centers structure and broadened the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic clinical and cancer control research over the next two decades the centers program grew progressively in there were comprehensive cancer centers in the nation today there are of these institutions all of which meet specific nci criteria for comprehensive status to attain recognition from the nci as a comprehensive cancer center an institution must pass rigorous peer review under guidelines newly established in the eight criteria for comprehensiveness include the requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields such as biology and molecular genetics a strong program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical practice moreover five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly beyond that required for attaining a cancer center support grant also referred to as a p or core grant the mechanism of choice for supporting the infrastructure of a cancer centers operations these criteria encompass strong participation in ncidesignated highpriority clinical trials significant levels of cancer prevention and control research and important outreach and educational activitiesall of which are funded by a variety of sources the other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit important new findings or address timely research questions hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april of the ncidesignated cancer centers are of the basic science type these centers engage almost entirely in basic research although some centers engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications from new discoveries in the laboratory clinical cancer centers in contrast focus on both basic research and clinical research within the same institutional framework and frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their overall research programs there are such centers today finally consortium cancer centers of which there is one are uniquely structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and control research these centers interface with state and local public health departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions responsible for implementing populationwide public health programs consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials together the ncidesignated cancer centers continue to work toward creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research and through interdisciplinary efforts to effectively move this research from

hoped to test a vaccine made by microgenesys inc and the national institutes of health which contended that multiple vaccines should be tested health and human services secretary donna shalala said a final announcement on the therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last friday companies including genentech inc chiron corp and immuno ag have already told nih that they are prepared to

reports that the clinton administration had decided the armys test of the microgenesys vaxsyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time the report was inaccurate and i expect there to be some announcement in the next hours about that particular aids research project said shalala administration sources subsequently confirmed that nih director dr bernadine healy and food and drug

generally accepted opinion of dr burzynskis research he paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an intolerant medical establishment but i have no basis from which to judge his claims two weeks ago however i read that the nihs department of alternative medicine has decided to focus their attention on burzynskis work their budget is so small that i imagine they wouldnt

treatment for brain glioblastoma this disease is universally and usually rapidly fatal after diagnosis in june the tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy the forum member checked extensively on dr burzynkis track record for this disease he spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from glioblastoma following this treatment and to an nci oncologist who had audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive after the forum members father began dr burzynskis treatment in september all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his oncologist in chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of shrinkage or necrosisthe patients oncologist although telling him he would probably not live past december was vehemently opposed to his trying dr burzynskis treatment since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under dr burzynskis treatment shes since changed her attitude toward continuing these treatments saying if it

universitythis overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain material covered will include structural and informational molecules the basic organization of the cell and of genetic material the central dogma of gene expression and selected other topics in the area of structure function and regulation as relates to current computational approaches dr noordewier has appointments in both computer science and biology at rutgers and has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition to his current work in computational biologypm introduction to artificial intelligence for biologists dr richard lathrop mit arris corpan overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be presented as it relates to actual and potential biological applications fundamental techniques symbolic programming languages and notions of search will be discussed as well as selected topics in somewhat greater detail such as knowledge representation inference and machine learning the intended audience includes biologists with some computational background but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence dr lathrop codeveloper of ariadne and related technologies has worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to biological problems in both academia and industrypm neural networks statistics and information theory in biological sequence analysis dr alan lapedes los alamos national laboratory this tutorial will cover the most rapidlyexpanding facet of intelligent systems for molecular biology that of machine learning techniques applied to sequence analysis closely interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general characteristics of sequences and the relationship of such approaches to statistical techniques and informationtheoretic views of sequence data dr lapedes of the theoretical division at los alamos has long been a leader in the use of such techniques in this domainpm genetic algorithms and genetic programming prof john koza stanford universitythe genetic algorithm an increasingly popular approach to highly nonlinear multidimensional optimization problems was originally inspired by a biological metaphor this tutorial will cover both the biological motivations and the actual implementation and characteristics of the algorithm genetic programming an extension wellsuited to problems where the discovery of the size and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem will also be addressed particular attention will be paid to biological applications and to identifying resources and software that will permit attendees to begin using the methods dr koza a consulting professor of computer science at stanford has taught this subject since and is the author of a standard text in the fieldpm linguistic methods in sequence analysis prof david searls university of pennsylvania shmuel pietrokovski weizmann instituteapproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies are increasingly in evidence these involve the adaptation of tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic pattern recognition and gene prediction the classification of genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory the identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes in sequence data and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and functional relatedness dr searls who holds research faculty appointments in both genetics and computer science at penn represents the branch of this field that considers higherorder syntactic approaches to sequence data while shmuel

is from a critique of a minutes presentation on msg which was aired on november rd the critique comes from the tufts diet and nutrition letter february edited for brevitychances are good that if you watched minutes last novemberrd you came away feeling msg is bad for you inthe segment entitled no msg for instance show host ed bradleymakes alarming statements without adequately substantiating themmillions are suffering a host of symptoms and some get violentlysick peppers his report with sensational but clinically unprovenpersonal testimony and speaks of studies on msg that make

school in orderto back up his comment that there is a lot of evidence that msga flavor enhancer in chinese and other asian cuisines as well asin many supermarket items causes headaches what he does notmake reference to is the fact that the study was performed not onhumans but on rabbitsone of the researchers who conducted the study pharmacologistpatricia williams phd says it certainly is conceivable thata small minority of people are sensitive enough to msg to get headaches from it but she explains the show probably overemphasized the extent of the problema second lapse comes with mention of dr john olney a professorat the washington university school of medicine who mr bradleyremarks says that his years of research with laboratoryanimals shows msg is a hazard for developing youngsters becauseit poses a threat of irreversible brain damage dr olneysresearch with lab animals does not show anything about humanyoungstersin fact only under extreme circumsrtances did dr olneys experiments ever bring about any brain damage when he injectedextremely high doses of msg into rodents completely bypassing their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directlyand when he used tubes to forcefeed huge amounts of the substanceto very young animals on an empty stomach of course neitherof those procedures occurs with humans they simply take in msg with food and most of what they take in is broken down byenzymes in the wall of the small intestine so that very littlereaches the bloodstream much to little in fact for humanblood levels of msg to come anywhere near the high concentrationsfound in dr olneys lab animalsthe world health organization appears to be very much aware ofthat fact and so does the european communities scientificcommittee for foodboth after examining numerous studieshave concluded that msg is safetheir determination makes sense considering that msg has neverbeen proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributedto it headaches swelling a tightness in the chest and aburning sensation among others in fact the most failsafeof clinical studies the doubleblind study has consistentlyexonerated the muchmaligned substancethats quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component ofmonosodium glutamate glutamate enters our systems wheneverwe eat any food that contains protein the reason is that oneof the amino acids that

justified in being pissed off at this doctor last saturday evening my year old son cut his finger badly with a knife i took him to a local urgent and general care clinic at pm the clinic was open till pm the receptionist went to the back and told the doctor that we were there and came back and told us the doctor would not see us because she had someplace to go at and did not want to be delayed here during the next few minutes in response to my questions with several trips to the back room the receptionist told me the doctor was doing paperwork in the back the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going to the emergency room the doctor would not even speak to me she would not tell me the doctors name or her own name when asked who is in charge of the clinic she said i dont know i realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room but i was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to be bothered my son did get three stitches at the emergency room speaking as a physician who works in an urgent care center the abovebehavior is completely inappropriate if a patient who requires extensivecare shows up at the last minute we always see them and give them appropriatecare it is reasonable for a clinic to refuse to see patients outside of itsposted hours but what you describe is misbehavior ask to speak to theclinic director

banschbachvmsocomokstateedusubject candidayeast bloom fact or fictioni can not believe the way this thread on candidayeast has progressedsteve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci med nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with its environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics these are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relieflike elaine in sci med nutrition and then when they find one that solves their problem the rest start yelling quack could it just be professional jealousy i couldnt help elaine or jonbut somebody else did could they know more than me no way they must be a quack ive been teaching a human nutrition course for medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are those that were raised on farms and saw firsthand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical schoolswitched to the vegan diet typically this is about of my class of students those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class thats okay because i know that some of what im teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the us its really too bad that most us medical schools dont cover nutrition because if they did candida would not be viewed as a nondisease by so many in the medical professionin animal husbandry an animal is reinnoculated with good bacteria after antibiotics are stopped medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach no such reinnoculation with good bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi systemmouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barriersteve got real upset with elaines doctor because he was using antifungals and vitamin a for her gi problems if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body he would notor at least should not be calling elaines doctor a quackhere is a brief primer on yeast yeast infections as they are commonly called are not truely caused by yeasts the most common organism responsiblefor this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually a yeastlike fungus an infection caused by this organism is called candidiasiscandidiasis is a very rare occurance because like an e coli infection it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposingfactor is present such as a high blood glucose leveldiabetes or an oral course of antibiotics has been used in diabetics their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose candida unlike bacteria is very limited in its foodfuel selection without glucose it can not grow it just barely survives if it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina in diabetics skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers the bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isnt certain when the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to treat itif its internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the gi tractmouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with thesenonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets about of all americans die with less vitamin a than they were born withus autopsy studies while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathologyblindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom while diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the antifungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candidaand recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then antifungal use should be approrpriate just as the antifungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr steve dyer saysbut even in patients being given the antifungals the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus gi tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressedlack of a good bacterial flora in the body andor poor mucus membrane barrier lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth from its name it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment in the vagina l acidophilius is the predominate bacteriaunless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics in the gi system the anorectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transferthrough moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occursabdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan has told me throiugh email that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positivescandida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on a constant basis i would want it fixed yes its nice to know that i dont have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me better steve dyer calls him a quackcandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment the vagina becomes alkaline during a womans period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tracti would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this my wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for antifungal creams this was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problemrecurring vaginal yeast infections this md did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and l acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile after three treatments sex returned to our marraige i have often wondered what an md with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a nonexistent syndromethe nonpathogenic bacteria l acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women if taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranesbut before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the bcomplex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b and folate these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this nonexistent disordercandida blooms after antibiotic therapy some of the above material was obtained from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gi system is involved if candida can not get glucose its not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gutif steve and some of the other naysayers want to jump all over this post fine i jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctors use of vitamin a and antifungals for a candida bloom in her gut

case of crohns disease but she cant seem to eat certain foods such as fresh vegetables without discomfort and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence her question is are there any nutritionists who specialize in the problems of people with crohns disease i saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric thanks in advance john eylesall your friend really has to do is find a registered dieticianrd while most work in hospitals and clinics many major cities will have rds who are in private practice so to speak many physicans will refer their patients with crohns disease to rds for dietary help if you can get your friends physician to make a referral medical insurance should pay for the rds services just like the services of a physical therapist the better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friends plan doesnt it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining healcrohns disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but im not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors for bad inflammation steroids are used but for a mild case the side effects are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use upjohn is developing a new lipoxygenase

the way this thread on candidayeast has progressedsteve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci med nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a woman poster for being treated by a licenced physician for a disease that did not exist calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well they are just responding in their natural way hypercholeric syndrome hcsoops that is not a recognized illness in the psychological communitybetter not say that since it therefore must not and never

typesand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well howeverwhen the nt person has selfimage challenges the darkside of thispersonality type usually comes out which should be obvious to alla physician who is a strong nt and who has not learned to temper theirtemperament will be extremely businesslike lack of empathy or feelingand is very compelled to have total control over their patient the patientmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question iveknown many mds of this temperament and suffice to say i dont oblige themwith a followup visit no matter how competent i think they are and theyusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is anextreme drive of theirs to know the most to know it allmaybe we need more nf doctors enough on this subject lets move on to candida bloomlet me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with its environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics could it just beprofessional jealousy i couldnt help elaine or jon but somebody else didyouve helped me already by your post of course i believe that i havebeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from anal retentivitis but beingthe phlegmatic i am maybe i was just a little too harsh on a few peoplemyself in past posts lets all try to raise the level of this discussionabove the level of anal effluenthumans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrierin my welldescribed situation in prior posts i definitely was immunestressed blood tests showed my vitamin a levels were very low my sinuseswere a mess no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damagedi also was on antibiotics times in years in the end even two weeksof ceftin did not work and i had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterialinfection of the sinuses via catscans mucus color wont get into thedetails and other symptoms three very traditional ents made thisdiagnosis i did not have any cultures done however because of thedifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showeda bacterial infection enough of this background provided to help youunderstand where i was when i make comments about my sporanox antifungaltherapy belowthe first question i have is this can fungus penetrate a little way into poormucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without beingconsidered systemic in the classic sense it is sort of an inbetweeninfectionsteve got real upset with elaines doctor because he was using antifungals and vitamin a for her gi problems if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body he would notor at least should not be calling elaines doctor a quacki was concerned too because of the toxicity of vitamin a my doctor aftermy blood tests put me on iu of vitamin a for one week only thendropped it down to iu for the next couple of weeks i also receivedzinc and other supplementation since all of these interrelate in fairlycomplex ways as my doctor explained hes one of those evil orthomolecularspecialists i had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin a was normalhe then stopped me on all vitamin a except for some in a multivitaminsupplement and made sure that i maintain a iuday of beta carotenecall me carrot face hopefully elaines doctor will take a similar careful approach and toall supplements im even reevaluating some supplements im taking forexample niacin in fairly large dosages gramday which steve dyer hadgood information about on scimednutrition if niacin only has secondorderimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies then it probably isnot worth taking such a large dose longterm and risking liver damagesurvives if it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina in though i do now believe based on my successful therapy with sporanox thati definitely had some excessive growth of fungus unknown species in mysinuses i still want to ask the question have there been any studies thatdemonstrate candida blooms in the sinuses with associated sinus irritationsinusitisrhinitis my sinus irritation reduced significantly after oneweek of sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during thistime i did not have any noticeable gi track problems before starting onsporanox but some for a few days after which then went away considerednormalbtw my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books sorry cantremember which one and found an obscure comment dating back into the swhich stated that people can develop contained nonlethal or nonseriousaspergillis infestations aspergiliosis of the sinuses leading to sinusinflammation symptoms ill have to dig out that reference again since itis relevant to this discussionsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isnt certainmy doctor tested me i believe a rast or rast similar test for allergicresponse to specificially candida albicans and i showed a strong positiveanother question would everybody show the same strong positive so this testis essentially useless and assuming it is true that candida can growpartway into the mucus membrane tissue and the concentration exceeds a threshold amount could not a person who tests as having an allergy tocandida definitely develop allergic symptoms such as mucus membraneirritation due to the bodys allergic response as i said in an earlier postone does not need to be a rocket scientist or have a md degree or a phd in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesisbtw and ill repost this again dr ivker in his book sinus survivalhas routinely given before anything else nizoral a presporanox systemicantifungal not as safe and not as good as sporanox to his new chronicsinusitis patients if they have been on antibiotics four or more times inthe last two years he claims that out of or so patients well over notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms but itdoesnt cure it by any means implying the socalled yeastfungus infectionis not the primary cause but a later complication hes also found thatnystatin whether taken internally or put into a sinus spray does not helpthis implies of course assuming that excessive yeastfungus bloom isaggravating the sinus inflammation that the yeastfungus has grown partwayinto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeastfungus other than bydirect contact it is not absorbed into the blood stream again i admitlots of ifs and implies which doesnt please the hardcore nt whohas to have the doubleblind study or its a nonissue but one has to startwith some plausible hypothesisexplanation a strawman if you willif its internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondescript this brings up an interesting observation used by those who will denyand reject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until theappropriate studies are done and that is if you cant observe or culturethe yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then theres no way to diagnose oreven recognize the disease and i know they realize that it is virtuallyimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannotbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the bodyits a real catchanother catch those who totally reject the yeast hypothesis say thatno studies have been done actually studies have been done but if its notup to a certain standard then it is from their perspective a nonstudy whichshould not even be considered i agree that the appropriate studies shouldbe done and that will take big to do it right however in order toconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their walletsyou literally have to give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence tocompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact studyneeded funding that is you have to do of the study before you even getfunding as a scientist at a national lab im very aware of this for thesmaller funded projects im afraid that even if dr ivker and otherdoctors got together pooled their practices case histories and anecdotesinto a compelling picture and approach the funding agencies they would getnowhere even if they were able to publish their statistical resultsit is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they havedecided excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading tonoticeable nonlethal symptoms does not exist and is not even a tenablehypothesis so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidenceto the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they wouldalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds its a done issue excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not willnot and cannot exist period kind of tough to dialog with those who holdsuch a viewpoint kind of reminds me of listercandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the gi tractmouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with thesenonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets about of all americans die with less vitamin a than they were born withus autopsy studies while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathologyblindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom arent there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of thesinus mucus membranes and ciliawhile diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the antifungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candidaand recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then antifungal use should be approrpriate just as the antifungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr steve dyer saysagain the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeastfungusspecies can grow hyphae roots into deep tissue similar to mold growingin bread you can continue to kill the surface such as nystatin does butyou cant kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemicantifungal such as itraconazole sporanox or some of the older ones suchas nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective this is why as hasbeen pointed out by recent studies sent to me by a doctor ive been inemail contact with thanks that nystatin is not effective in the longterm treatment of gi tract candidiasis its like trying to weed a gardenby cutting off whats above the ground but leaving the roots ready to comeout again once you walk awaythe question is whether a contained candida bloom can partiallygrow into tissue through the mucus membranes causing some types of symptomsin susceptible people eg allergy without becoming systemic in theclassical sense of the word something in between strictly an excessivebloom not causing any problems and the fullblown systemic infection thatis potentially lethalin the gi system the anorectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transferthrough moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear also if one is an anal retentive like ive been diagnosed in a priorpost that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occursabdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan has told me throiugh email that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positivescandida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on a constant basis i would want it fixed yes its nice to know that i dont have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me better steve dyer calls him a quackas ive said in private email there are flaws in our current medical systemthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attemptalternative therapies after the approvedprovenaccepted therapies dont workfor example i went to three ents who all said that i will just have to livewith my acutechronic sinusitis after the abs failed they did mentionsurgery to open up the ostia but my ostia werent plugged and it would notget to the root cause of my condition after three months of aggressive andfairly nonstandard therapy sporanox body nutrient level monitoring andequalization vitamin c lentinen echinacea etc my health has vastlyimproved to where i was two years ago before my health greatly deterioratedof course skeptics would say that maybe if i did nothing i would haveimproved anyway but that view is stretching things quite far because of theexperience of the three ents i saw who said that id just have to live withit im confident i will reach what one could call a total cure theantifungal program i undertook was one necessary step in that directionbecause of my overuse of abs for the last four years note for thosehaving sinus problems may i suggest the book by dr ivker i mention abovebe sure to get the revised editioni have often wondered what an md with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a nonexistent syndromedr ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems and hisvisits to several ents totally floored him when they said youll just haveto live with it he spent several years trying everything standard andnonstandard until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis he nowshares his approach in his book and i can honestly say that i am on the roadto recovery following some parts of it his one recommendation to take asystemic antifungal at the beginning of treatment if you have a history ofantibiotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his ownpractice im sure if i commented to him of the hardcore beliefs of the antiyeast hypothesis posters that he would have definite things to say such asits worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases to put it mildlyi also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violatingtheir moral obligations to help the patientmaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and areconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the hypotheticalyeast overgrowth eg they fit some of the profiles the proyeast peoplehave identified should consider antifungal therapy if all other avenueshave been exhausted remember theory and practice are two different things you cannot have one without the other they are synergistic if a doctor doessomething nonstandard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over athousand of his patients shouldnt you at least sit up and take noticemaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it worksinstead of why it shouldnt work im afraid a lot of doctors have becomeso enamored with scientific correctness that they are ignoring the patientsthey have sworn to help you have to do both both have to be balanced whichwe dont see from some of the posters to this group there comes a point whenyou just have to use a little common sense and maybe an empirical approachsuch as trying a good systemic antifungal such as sporanox after havingexhausted all the other avenues i was one of those who the traditionalmedical establishment was not able to help so i did the natural thing iwent to a couple of doctors who are somewhat outside this establishmentand as a result i have found significant reliefwould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set upsome kind of mechanism where any doctor without fear of being sued or havinghis license pulled can try experimental and unproven beyond a doubttherapies for hisher patients that finally reach the point where all theaccepted therapies are ineffective id like to hear a doctor tell mewell ive tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in thiscountry and since they clearly dont work for you i now have the authorityto use experimental unproven techniques that seem to have helped others icant promise anything and there are some risks you will have to signsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature ofthese unproven therapies and ill have to register your case at the stateboard anyway if my ent had suggested this to me i wouldve jumped on thispronto instead of going to one of those doctors who for either altruisticreasons or for greed is practicing these alternative therapies with muchrisk to himher risk meaning losing their license and possibly to thepatient such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicineand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free it also wouldbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing thecompassion of the medical community to the patient that its doing everythingit can within reason to help the patient it is the lack of such a mechanismthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies some ofwhich seem to work like my case and others of which will never work at alltrue quackeryi better get off my soapbox before this post reaches k in sizeif taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranesbut before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the bcomplex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b and folate these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this nonexistent disordercandida blooms after antibiotic therapywhat dosage of b appears to be necessary to promote the healing and properworking of the mucos memebranessome of the above material was obtained from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gi system is involved if candida can not get glucose its not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gutid like to see the role of complex carbohydrates such as starchif steve and some of the other naysayers want to jump all over this post fine i jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctors use of vitamin a and antifungals for a candida bloom in her gut people seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our hearts content if you saved your venom for me steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help alone i wouldnt have a problem with your behavior brave

usually given intra muscularly use a thin needle guage and select a spot on the upper outer thigh no major nerves or blood vessels there clean the area with antiseptic before injection and after make sure to inject deeply a different kind of pain is felt when the needle enters the muscle contrasted to the prick when it pierces the skin ps try to go to a doctor selftreatment and selfinjection should be avoided as far as possible the areas that are least likely to hurt are where you have a little fat i inject on my legs and gut and prefer the gut i can stickit in at a degree angle and barely feel it im not fat justhave a little gut my legs however are muscular and i have to pinchto get anything and then i inject at about a degree angleand itstill hurts the rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and muscular injections howeverso if its a daily thing it would bebest not to switch places every day to keep consistencey althoughsome suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot to prevent irritation when you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep wait for it to dry somewhat or you may get the alcohol in thepuncture and of course that doesnt feel good a way to preventirratation is to mark the spot that you injected a good way todo this is use a little round bandage and put it over the spot this helps prevent you from injecting in the same spotand spacing the sites out accuartely about apartthis is from experience so i hope itll help you i havediabetes and have to take an injection every morninglaterdavid david hahnuniversity of wisconsin

is rd portland or from heartaccessdigexcom gsubject cholistasisspfatfree dietpregnancyhiive just returned from a visit with my obgyn and i have a few concerns that maybe yall can help me with ive been seeing her every weeks for the past few months im at week and during the last visits ive gained to pounds every weeks she said this was unacceptable over any week period as it stands ive thus far gained pounds also she says that though im at weeks the babys size is weeks i think she mentioned inches for the top of the fundus when i was weeks the babys size was weeks i must also add that i had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and ive had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and i have a very difficult time moving and the doc has recommended i not walk or move unless i have to i have a little handicapped sticker for when i do need to go out anyway thats of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy i was getting sick throwing up about times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated i told her about this i know this because i wasnt eating very much due to the nausea and could see the results well now i only get sick about once every weeks and it is still bile related but in addition i had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when i was lying on my right side it began to get worse though because it started to hurt when i lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position i was in next i noticed that when i ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse however if i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it wasnt as much of a problemso the doctor says i have cholistatis and that i should avoid fatty foods this makes sense and because i was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have been avoiding these foods on my own but im still able to eat foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods but doc wants me to be on a nonfat diet this means no meat except fish and chicken wo skin i do this anyway no nuts fried food cheese etc i am allowed skim milk she said i should avoid anything sweet eg bananas also i must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice she said i cant even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or steamed im concerned because i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process and if im not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores and why this restriction on carbohydrates if shes concerned about fat im not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis which i cant seem to find any information on she originally said that i should only gain pounds during the entire pregnancy since i was about lbs overweight when i started but my sister gained lbs during her pregnancy and shes taken it all off and hasnt had any problems she also asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them are anyway i think she is overly concerned about weight gain and feel like im being punished by a severe diet she did want to

apraiojscnasagovspenserfuddjscnasagov s spenser aden wrote interesting statements simply because i have been told otherwise im certainly not questioning steves claims as for one i am not a doctor and i agree that foods dont bring on the recurrence of crohns but inflammation can be either mildly or drastically enhanced due to foodthe feeling obout this has changed in the gi community the currentfeelingis that inflammation is not induced by food there is even evidence thatpatients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulationofintestinal growth factors there is now interest in providing smallamountsof nasogastric feeding to patients on iv nutrition but i digress symptoms can be drastically enhanced by food but not inflammation having had one major obstruction resulting in resection is that a good enough caveat i was told that a low residue diet is called for basically the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut which may not be realized by the patient any residue in the system can be caught in the folds of inflammation and constantly irritate thus exacerbating the problem therefore anything that doesnt digest completely by the point of common inflammation should be avoided with what ive been told is typical crohns of the terminal ileum my diet should be low residue consisting of completely out never again items o corn kernel husk doesnt digest most of us know this o popcorn same o dried dehydrated fruit and fruit skins o nuts very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge the low residue diet is appropriate for you if you still have obstructionsagain it is not felt that food causes inflammation these foods areavoided because they may get stuck id go ahead and have thefudge though discouraged greatly o raw vegetables too fibrous o wheat and raw grain breads o exotic lettuce iceberg is ok since its apparently mostly water o greens turnip mustard kale etc o little seeds like sesame try getting an arbys without it o long grain and wild rice husky o beans youll generate enough gas alone without them o basically anything that requires heavy digestive processing i was told that the more processed the food the better rather ironic in this day and age the whole point is preventative you want to give your system as little chance to inflame as possible i was told that among the numerous things that were heavily discouraged i only listed a few to try the ones i wanted and see how i felt if its bad dont do it again remember though that this was while i was in remission for veggies cook the daylights out of them i prefer steaming i think its cooks more thoroughly youre mileage may vary as with anything else check with your doctor dont just take my word but this is the info ive been given and it may be a starting point for discussion good luck spencer makes an especially good point in having an observant andinformed patient would that many patients be able to tell whatcauses them problems the digestive processing idea is changing butif a food causes problems avoid them be sure that the foods are tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause crohnscommonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up withseverly restricted diets that take months to renormalizethere was a good article in the ccfa newsletter recently that discussedthe issue of dietary restriction of

in sci med nutrition about vitamin c and oxalate productiontoxic kidney stone formation i decided to post my answer here as well because of the recent question about kidney stones not long after i got into sci med i got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation im going to state it again herebut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take b supplements read on to find out whyi have my asbestos suit on now guysvitamin c will form oxalic acid but large doses are needed above grams per day review article nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney stones with particular emphasis on vitamin c int clin nutr rev but glycine also forms oxalic aciddamino acid oxidases for both glycine and vitamin c one of the best ways to drastically reduce this production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin c or glycine but to increase your intake of vitamin b control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in patients with kidney stones int urol nephrol to mg of b each day significasntly decreased the urinary excretion of oxalate over the month treatment program the action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria clin sci patients receiving at least mg b each day showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levelsfor gylcine this effect is due to increased transaminase activityb is required for transaminase activity which makes less glycine available for oxidative deaminationdamino acid oxidases for vitamin c the effect is quite different there are different pathways for vitamin c catabolism the pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have to of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid but this is highly variable and the vitamin c review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto grams per day not too much vitamin c gets catabolized to form oxalic acid at very high doses of vitamin cabove grams per day more of the extra vitamin c more than conversion can end up as oxalic acid in a very early study on vitamin c and oxalic productionproc soc exp biol med intakes of grams per day up to grams per day increased the average oxalic acid excretion from mg per day up to mg per day until grams per day was reached the average excreted was increased by only to mg per day gram dose gram dose gram dose and gram dose grams jumped it to mg over the average excretion before supplementation and grams jumped it to mg over the average before supplementationb is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body there are probably some enzymes that require vitamin b that we dont know about yet vitamin c catabolism is still not completely understood but the speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires b differences in b levels could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin c challengethis is not the preferred route of catabolism increasing your intake of b would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin c supplements since the typical american diet is deficient in b some researchers believe that the main cause of calciumoxalate kidney stones is b deficiencyespecially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from the gut diets providing to mg of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalateurol int if mg was present each day there was a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretionhere are the high oxalate foods beans coca instant coffee parsley rhubarb spinach and tea contain at least mggrams beet tops carrots celery chocolate cumber grapefruit kale peanuts pepper sweet potatoe contain to mggramsif the threshold is mg per day you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food selection a recent nengj med article also points out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being absorbed at all if you also increase your intake of b you shouldnt have to worry about kidney stones at all the rda for b is mg per day for males and mg per day for femalesdirectly related to protein intakeb can be toxicnerve damage if it is consumed in doses of mg or more per day for an extended peroidweeks to months the usda food survey done in had an average intake of mg per day for males and mg per day for females living in the us coupled with this low intake was a high protein dietwhich greatly increases the b requirement as well as the presence of some of the different drugs that either block b absorption are metabolic antagonists of b or promote b excretion in the urine common ones are birth control pills alcoholisoniazid penicillamine and corticosteroids i tell my students to supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that increase the b requirement the dose recommended for patients taking birth control pills is mg per day and this should work for most of the other drugs that increase the b requirementthis would be on top of your dietary intake of b any patient that has a history of kidney stone formation should be given b supplementsone other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your camg dietary ratio is magnesiumoxalate is much more soluble than is calciumoxalate the

prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid function for the purpose of quick weight loss using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has been shown to be ineffective and dangerouscyanide release by the ncithese are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should not committ but sometimes do there are also errors of omissionsome of which result in malpractice suits i dont think that using antifungal agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be having a problem with candidaor another fungal growth is an error of commission or omission healers have had a long history of trying to relieve human suffering some have stuck to standard approved proceduresothers have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a chance that it will help the patient the key has to be tied to the healers oath i will do no harm but you know david that very few treatments involve no risk to the patient the job of the physician is a very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed each physician deals with this riskbenefit paradox a little differently some are very conservative while others are more agressive an agressive approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long as the motive is improving the patients health and not an attempt to rake in lots of moneythrough some of the schemes that have been uncovered in the medicare fraud cases i dont see the need to label these healers as quacks or even unethicalwhat do i reserve the term quack for pseudomedical professionals these people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the frustrated patient to fall into their lair some of these individuals are really doing a pretty good job of providing alternative medicine but many lack any formal training and are in the business simply to make a few fast bucks while a patient can be reasonably assured of getting competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted this alternative care area is really a buyers beware arena if you are lucky you may find someone who can help you if you are unlucky you can loose a lot of money and

outof kilter and you get sick and dieive never heard of anyone being poisened this way in or out of reallife the process takes quite a while if anyone wants to write thisbook i would imagine you would have to replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy water wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuteriumduring this process the victim would gradually deteriorate andeventually die but i imagine it would take weeks during which thepoisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of thewater the victim ingested was heavyyou would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be bothalarmed and confused why should every organ in the body suddenlybegin to deteriorate if you can figure out how the poisoner gets theheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a realstory herecome to think of it would continue even after the heavy water wasno longer being

obgyn and i have a few concerns that maybe yall can help me with ive been seeing her every weeks for the past few months im at week and during the last visits ive gained to pounds every weeks she said this was unacceptable over any week period as it stands ive thus far gained pounds also she says that though im at weeks the babys size is weeks i think she mentioned inches for the top of the fundus when i was weeks the babys size was weeks i must also add that i had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and ive had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and i have a very difficult time moving and the doc has recommended i not walk or move unless i have to i have a little handicapped sticker for when i do need to go out anyway thats of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy i was getting sick throwing up about times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated i told her about this i know this because i wasnt eating very much due to the nausea and could see the results well now i only get sick about once every weeks and it is still bile related but in addition i had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when i was lying on my right side it began to get worse though because it started to hurt when i lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position i was in next i noticed that when i ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse however if i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it wasnt as much of a problemso the doctor says i have cholistatis and that i should avoid fatty foods this makes sense and because i was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have been avoiding these foods on my own but im still able to eat foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods but doc wants me to be on a nonfat diet this means no meat except fish and chicken wo skin i do this anyway no nuts fried food cheese etc i am allowed skim milk she said i should avoid anything sweet eg bananas also i must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice she said i cant even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or steamed im concerned because i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process and if im not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores and why this restriction on carbohydrates if shes concerned about fat im not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis which i cant seem to find any information on she originally said that i should only gain pounds during the entire pregnancy since i was about lbs overweight when i started but my sister gained lbs during her pregnancy and shes taken it all off and hasnt had any problems she also asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them are anyway i think she is overly concerned about weight gain and feel like im being punished by a severe diet she did want to see me again in one week so i think she the diet may be temporary for that one week what i want to know is how reasonable is this nonfat diet i would understand if she had said lowfat diet since im trying that anyway even if she said really lowfat diet i think she assumes i must be eating a highfat diet but really it is that because of the endometriosis and the operation im not able to use the energy from the food i do eat any opinions info and experiences will be appreciated im truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few minutes and ill end up having to eat constantly thus far i dont find any foods satisfyingthanks gfor one week she probably wants to see how you react to the diet if itchanges anything you can live on the diet but you need to up your calories where before youhad a pat of butter now you need a medium apple probably microwavecooked smaller meals but more of them not terrific amounts of meat itshard to digest anyway for comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta orrice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn maybesmaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area is thebaby still coming up is it starting to push or rub under your ribs howtight are your clothes you shouldnt be wearing any clothing that compresses your middle be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting again itwill put pressure on the digestive tract try laying on your sides backand stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactiveeasier on your legs circulation as well you might try letting the babyturn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last monthswhen you are shortwaisted its easy for that baby to end up right under thediaphram especially if you have tight abdominal muscles if i had mysecond one to do over again i think id have tried to loosen up since hedidnt turn sideways until late and the relief was enormousmaybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybeshe just nags all her patients this way especially if shes young but this gallbladderwhatever problem that might be coming up is somethingto be avoided if possible nausea etc can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy

was showing all the differentdeffects that could be detected using the ultrasoundshould my wife be concerned should we take the pictures to a radiologist for a second opinion and if so where would we findsuch an expert in chicago we dont really have any special medicalreason to be concerned but if a radiologist will be able to seethings the obgyn cant then i dont see why we shouldnt use oneany thoughts as far as i can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his roomsand is expirienced its use and interpretation he should be just ascapable of reading it as any radiologist all doctors are qualified toread xrays us ct scans etc it is just that a radiologist does nothingelse and thus is only better at reading them because of all this timespent doing this skill in reading xrays etc just comes from plenty ofpractice if your obstetrition reads heaps of obstetric ultrasounds heshould be able to pick up any abnormalities that can be demonstrated bythis technique paul zikzak public

alsoquacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase in spite of the fact that itscompletely broken down in the guts but this doesnt change the genuinescientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fightingoxidative damage same thing just cause there are candida quacks thatdoesnt establish evidence against the candida hypothesis if theres someother reason besides the quacks if only anecdotal to think it could betrue then that is what has to be considered that is what the net peoplehave been talking aboutbut again there is no point in arguing about it there is anecdotalevidence and there is no convincing evidence and there are also somecandida quacks out there i hope everyone can agree on all of that thusit appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents canmarshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enoughmanner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled doubleblindstudy of antifungals or else forget convincing

considers himself a surgeon now im a surgeon with great experience although i have nolicense to practice but if i operate on a person and he livesnormally thats the greatest license a surgeon could have evacuated by the un this week to his home town of tuzlathe muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment ofthe horrors of the yearlong serb siege of srebrenica and thesuffering of the thousands trapped there i lived through hell together with the people ofsrebrenica all those who lived through this are the greatestheroes that humanity can produce he told reporters mujanovic had practiced for two months as an assistantat a local hospital in tuzla but before going to srebrenica hehad never performed a surgical operation on his own now he sayshe has performed major surgery times relying on books forguidance amputating arms and legs times usually withoutanesthetic delivering babies and performing four cesareansections he worked tohour days slept in the hospital for thefirst weeks after his arrival last aug and treated patients he arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot fromtuzla miles northwest of srebrenica about other peoplecarried in supplies and soldiers guided and protected himthrough guerrilla terrain he said his worst memory was of days ago when seven serb shellslanded within one minute in an area half the size of a footballfield killing people immediately and wounding half ofthe dead were women and children the people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and thechildren were playing soccer there was no warning theblood flowed like a river in the street he said there were pieces of women all around and you could notpiece them together one woman holding her two children in herhands was lying with them on the ground dead they had noheads before mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions weredeplorable he said many deaths could have been prevented hadthe hospital had surgical tools facilities and medicine the six general practitioners who had been operating beforehe arrived had even less surgical experience than he did theydidnt know the basic principles for amputating limbs once he arrived the situation improved he said but bymidseptember he had run out of supplies bandages were washed and boiled five times sometimesthey were falling apart in my hands he said doctors had noanesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the painbecause it increased bleeding people were completely conscious during amputations andstomach operations he said blood transfusions wereimpossible because they had no facilities to test blood types i felt destroyed psychologically mujanovic said the situation improved after dec when a convoy arrivedfrom the belgian medical group medecins sans frontieres but mujanovic said the military predicament worsened inmiddecember after bosnian serbs began a major offensive in theregion every day we had air strikes and shellings then the hunger set in between middecember and midmarch when us planes beganair dropping food between and people were dying every dayfrom complications associated with malnutrition he said i know for sure that the air drop operation saved thepeople from

to stone and the pain in the area got worse however if i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it wasnt as much of a problemso the doctor says i have cholistatis and that i should avoid fatty foods this makes sense and because i was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have been avoiding these foods on my own but im still able to eat foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods but doc wants me to be on a nonfat diet this means no meat except fish and chicken wo skin i do this anyway no nuts fried food cheese etc i am allowed skim milk she said i should avoid anything sweet eg bananas also i must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice she said i cant even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or steamed im concerned because i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process and if gfor one week she probably wants to see how you react to the diet if itchanges anything you can live on the diet but you need to up your nonfat calories wherebefore you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple probably microwavecooked smaller meals but more of them not terrific amounts of meat itshard to digest anyway first even fish fowl and breads have fat secondthe body will make fat out of carbohydrates if it needs them third yourbody like most peoples wasnt bred to live on a high fat modern dietif you read texts about ancient and primative people you will read aboutthe luxury of eating fat how people enjoyed it this was because it was sorare even cows didnt put out nearly the amount of butterfat in milk thatthey do now for comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat

bottled sauces in seasoning mixtures and in the coating on barbecue potato chips nacho cheese doritos breading for many frozen fried foods like fishand chicken etc ad naseum if msg is really the

demonstrate your claim you would have had to supervise the preparation on both occasions perhaps they used msg both times and lied about it perhaps once they used something that had begun to spoil and

the stuff without myseldane and did i ever learn to read labels please note that i am not saying you are making it up i am just trying to point out that the situation is not always as simple as it might seem which was why i started checking every time i got sick and everytime i got sick msg was somehow involved in one of the food productsand consider there were no other similar ingredients to my knowledge it might not please a medical researcher but it pleased my ownpersonal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and mostimportantly its enough proof for me to avoid it and enough proofthat my incredibly frugal fiance didnt flinch when i literally threwout or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg and he always flinches when theres waste but it was a

the publics perception of doctors and their salariesi hope some of you will find it as amusing as i didreprinted wo permissiontheres no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors salariesby mike roykotribune media services on a stupidity scale a recent poll about doctors earnings is right up there it almost scored a perfect braindead it was commissioned by some whiny consumers group called families usa the poll tells us that the majority of americans believe that doctors make too much money the pollsters also asked what a fair income would be for physicians those polled said oh about a year would be ok how generous how sporting how stupid why is this poll stupid because it is based on resentment and envy two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign and are still simmering you could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns plus and get the same results since the majority of americans dont make those bucks they assume that those who do are stealing it from them maybe the berlin wall came down but dont kid yourself karl marx lives its also stupid because it didnt ask key questions such as do you know how much education and training it takes to become a physician if those polled said no they didnt know then they should have been disqualified if they gave the wrong answers they should have been dropped what good are their views on how much a doctor should earn if they dont know what it takes to become a doctor or maybe a question should have been phrased this way how much should a person earn if he or she must a get excellent grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in order to b be accepted by a good college and spend four years taking courses heavy in math physics chemistry and other lab work and maintain a average or better and c spend four more years of grinding study in medical school with the third and fourth years in clinical training working to hours a week and d spend another year as a lowpay hardwork intern and e put in another three to years of postgraduate training depending on your specialty and f maybe wind up in debt after medical school and g then work an average of hours a week with many family doctors putting in hours or more until they retire or fall over as you have probably guessed by now i have considerably more respect for doctors than does the law firm of clinton and clinton and all the lawyers and insurance executives they have called together to remake americas health care based on what doctors contribute to society they are far more useful than the powerhappy egotripping programspewing social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is to health what clintons first budget is to frugality but propaganda works and as the stupid poll indicates many americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are the major cause of high medical costs of course doctors are wellcompensated they should be americans now live longer than ever but who is responsible for our longevitylawyers congress or the guy flipping burgers in a mcdonalds and the doctors prolong our lives despite our having become a nation of selfindulgent lardbutted tvgaping couch cabbages ah that is not something you heard president clinton or super spouse talk about during the campaign or since but instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a villain they might have been more honest if they had said let us talk about medical care and one of the biggest problems we have that problem is you my fellow american yes you eating too much and eating the wrong foods many of you guzzling too much hooch still puffing away at a pack getting your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to the microwave to the couch doing dope and bringing crack babies into the world filling the big city emergency rooms with gunshot victims engaging in unsafe sex and catching a deadly disease while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure you and your habits not the doctors are the single biggest health problem in this country if anything it is amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do in fact i dont understand how they can stand looking at your blubbery bods all day so as your president i call upon you to stop whining and start living cleanly now i must go get myself a triple cheesygreasy with double fries do as i say not as i do but for those who truly believe that doctors are overpaid there is another solution dont use them thats right you dont feel well then try one of those spine poppers needle twirlers or have rev bubba lay his

approximately million annual deliveries in the united states since table the cesarean rate in the united states is the third highest among reporting countries exceeded only by brazil and puerto rico this report presents data on cesarean deliveries from cdcs national hospital discharge survey nhds for and compares these data with previous years data on discharges from shortstay nonfederal hospitals have been collected annually since in the nhds conducted by cdcs national center for health statistics for medical and demographic information were abstracted from a sample of inpatients discharged from participating hospitals the cesareans and vaginal births after a prior cesarean vbac presented in this report are based on weighted national estimates from the nhds sample of approximately women discharged after delivery the estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were calculated by applying cesarean rates from the nhds to live births from national vital registration data therefore estimates of the number of cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based solely on the nhds stated differences in this analysis are significant at the confidence level based on the twotailed ttest with a critical value of in there were cesareans per deliveries the same rate as in and similar to rates during table the primary cesarean rate ie number of first cesareans per deliveries to women who had no previous cesareans for also was stable ranging from to in the cesarean rate in the south was significantly p higher than the rates for the west midwest and northeast rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to years than for younger women in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or government hospitals in hospitals with fewer than beds than in larger hospitals and for deliveries for which blue crossblue shield and other private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of payment table the same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries since the early s the number and percentage of births to older women increased however if the age distribution of mothers in had remained the same as in the overall cesarean rate in would have been essentially the same as the observed based on the nhds of the approximately live births in an hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april estimated were by cesarean delivery of these an estimated births were repeat cesareans and were primary cesareans since approximately primary cesareans have been performed annually in of women who had a previous cesarean delivered vaginally compared with in of all cesareans in were associated with a previous cesarean with dystocia ie failure of labor to progress with breech presentation with fetal distress and with all other specified complications the average hospital stay for all deliveries in was days in comparison the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was days and for a repeat cesarean days nearly twice the duration for vbac deliveries days or for vaginal deliveries that were not vbacs days in the average hospital stay for all deliveries was days for primary cesareans days for repeat cesareans days and for vbac and nonvbac vaginal deliveries and days respectively reported by office of vital and health statistics systems national center for health statistics cdc editorial note the cesarean rate in the united states steadily increased from through however the findings in this report indicate that rates have been stable since because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth a national health objective for the year is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to or fewer per deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to or fewer per deliveries objective postpartum complications including urinary tract and wound infections may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than for vaginal births moreover the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase healthcare costs for example in the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were and respectively the additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes for physician fees and for hospital charges if the cesarean rate in had been the year objective instead of the number of cesarean births would have decreased by versus resulting in a savings of more than billion in physician fees and hospital charges despite the steady increase in vbac rates since several factors may impede progress toward the year national health objectives for cesarean delivery for example vbac rates substantially reflect the number of women offered trial of labor which has been increasingly encouraged since of women who are offered a trial of labor could deliver vaginally a level already achieved by many hospitals trial of labor was routinely offered in of hospitals surveyed in the most recent year for which hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april national data are available when the vbac rate according to nhds data was the year objective specifies a vbac rate of based on all women who had a prior cesarean regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted to reach the overall cesarean rate goal however increases in the vbac rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate one hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery by requiring a second opinion and by instituting a peerreview process other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries public dissemination of physician and hospitalspecific cesarean delivery rates to increase public awareness of differences in practices and addressing malpractice concerns which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of

challenging and complex problem because of increasing drug resistance although the risk of acquiring malaria for us citizens and their dependents stationed overseas generally has been low this risk varies substantially and unpredictably during may the office of medical services department of state omsdos and cdc were notified of an increased number of malaria cases among official us personnel stationed in kampala uganda a review of the health records from the embassy health unit ehu in kampala indicated that cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from march through june compared with two cases during the same period in ehu omsdos and cdc conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and identify potential risk factors for malaria among us embassy personnel this report summarizes the results of the investigation malaria blood smears from of the reported casepatients were available for review by omsdos and cdc a case of malaria was confirmed if the slide was positive for plasmodium sp of the persons were slideconfirmed as having malaria a questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the ehu to obtain information about residence activities use of malaria chemoprophylaxis and use of personal protection measures ie using bednets and insect repellents having window and door screens and wearing long sleeves and pants in the evening of the persons eligible for the survey responded risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in kampala although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less than or equal to years than among persons greater than years this difference was not significant relative risk rr confidence interval ci eightytwo percent of the cases occurred among persons who had been living in kampala for years compared with those living there less than year travel outside of the kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for malaria four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who participated in the survey mefloquine chloroquine and proguanil chloroquine alone and proguanil alone in addition persons who responded were not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis the risk for malaria was significantly lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis rr ci twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason the risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april all or most of the time than among persons who sometimes or rarely used bednets rr ci the risk for malaria was also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening compared with those who rarely used repellent rr upper confidence limit risk for malaria was not associated with failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the evening as a result of this investigation ehu staff reviewed with all personnel the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens ehu staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection measures and made plans to obtain insecticideimpregnated bednets and to provide window and door screens for all personnel reported by us embassy health unit kampala uganda office of medical svcs dept of state washington dc malaria br div of parasitic diseases national center for infectious diseases cdc editorial note in uganda the increase in malaria among us personnel was attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in subsaharan africa the findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in malariaendemic areas preventive measures that are also important for shortterm travelers to such areas mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in africa and in most other areas with chloroquineresistant p falciparum however in some areas eg thailand resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness in africa the efficacy of mefloquine compared with chloroquine alone in preventing infection with p falciparum is mefloquine is safe and well tolerated when given at mg per week over a year period the risk for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis eg psychosis and convulsions is low ie episodes per users while the risk for less severe adverse reactions eg dizziness gastrointestinal complaints and sleep disturbances is similar to that for other antimalarial chemoprophylactics doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine but the need for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this

epidemiology basic molecular virology mucosal immunology and oral clinical presentations of hiv infection the workshop was organized by dr john greenspan and dr deborah greenspan of the department of stomatology school of dentistry university of california san francisco an international steering committee and scientific program committee provided guidance the conference drew more than scientists from countries including asia africa europe central america south america as well as the united states and canada support tor the workshop was provided by the national institute of dental research the national cancer institute the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases the nih office of aids research and the procter and gamble company among the topics discussed were the epidemiology of hiv lesions ethics professional responsibility and public policy occupational issues provision of oral care to the hivpositive population salivary hiv transmission and mucosal immunity opportunistic infections pediatric hiv infection and womens issues recommendations recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of hiv to establish a universal terminology for hivassociated oral lesions to look for more effective treatments for oral manifestations to expand molecular biology studies to understand the relationship between hiv infection and common oral lesions and to study the effects of hiv therapy on oral lesions epidemiology since the first international workshop on oral manifestations of hiv infection was convened five years ago the epidemiology of hiv infection has hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april radically changed in hiv infection was detected and reported largely in homosexual and bisexual males intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs today more hiv infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in children and adolescents while the predominant impact of hiv infection has been felt in africa a major increase in infection rate is being seen in southeast asia as well five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more are appearing all the time researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis they also are beginning to explore the relationships between specific oral lesions and hiv disease progression and prognosis socialpolitical issues discussion on the social and political implications of hiv infection focused on changing the publics attitude that aids is retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use speakers also addressed health care delivery for hivinfected patients and the need to educate the public about what aids is and how it is acquired saliva and salivary glands conference speakers described transmission issues and the hivinhibitory activity of saliva the strength of which varies among the different salivary secretions whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular secretions which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid secretions research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible for salivary inhibitory activity they attributed the hivinhibitory effect of saliva to the aggregationagglutination of hiv by saliva which may both promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell and direct effects on the virus or target cells other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease in hivinfected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity pediatric issues pediatric aids recently has emerged as an area of intense interest with early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment the life expectancy of hivinfected children has tripled the prevention of transmission of hiv from mother to child may be possible in many cases particularly if the mothers serostatus is known prior to giving birth periodontal and gingival tissue diseasehicnet medical newsletter page volume number april oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and gingivitis found in individuals

otherwise be possible said hhs secretary louis w sullivan md the effort to accelerate fda review for these drugs has been a longterm commitment and indeed a hallmark of this administration these rules establish procedures for the food and drug administration to approve a drug based on surrogate endpoints or markers they apply when the drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies such endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval earlier than if traditional endpoints such as relief of disease symptoms or prevention of disability and death from the disease are used the new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and effectiveness based on surrogate endpoints can be reasonably established the drugs sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drugs effect on the surrogate endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness one new drug zalcitabine also called ddc was approved june using a model of this process for treating the human immunodeficiency virus hiv the cause of aids accelerated approval can also be used if necessary when fda determines that a drug judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease can be used safely only under a restricted distribution plan the new rules will help streamline the drug

retinal disease national retinitis pigmentosa foundation neutrophilic factors rescue photoreceptor cells in animal tests baltimore md researchers at the university of california san francisco and regeneron pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq regn have discovered that certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can prevent the degeneration of lightsensing cells in the retina of the eye the degeneration of these cells known as photoreceptors is a major cause of visual impairment this research published to in the december issue of the proceedings of the national academy of science pnas holds promise for people who may lose their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration currently no drug treatment for retinal degeneration exists it is estimated that million americans have severe vision loss due to agerelated macular degeneration and americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus a hereditary disease that causes blindness in addition each year more than people undergo surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas the research was funded in part by the rp retinitis pigmentosa foundation fighting blindness regeneron

survivalpromoting activity of a number of naturally occurring substances experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their photoreceptor cells the rods and cones of the retina after light exposure brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf and ciliary neurotrophic factor cntf were particularly effective in this model without causing unwanted side effects other factors such as nerve growth factor ngf and insulinlike growth factor igf were not effective in these experiments discussing the research dr jesse m

increases risk of heart disease research resources reporter written by mary weideman novdec national institutes of health highfat highcalorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have traditionally consumed diets low in fat these findings according to investigators at the oregon health sciences university in portland have serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing countries this study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels it shows also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing countries and affluent nations as well explains principal investigator dr william e connor head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at oregon health sciences university over the past years dr connor and his team have characterized the food and nutrient intakes of the tara humara indians in mexico while simultaneously documenting various aspects of tarahumara lipid metabolism these native mexicans number approximately and reside in the sierra madre occidental mountains in the state of chihuahua the tarahumaras have coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing probably as a result coronary heart disease which is so prevalent in western industrialized nations is virtually non existent in their culture loosely translated the name tarahumara means fleet of foot reflecting a tribal passion for betting on kickball races in which participants run distances of miles or more while kicking a machetecarved wooden ball the typical tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans tortillas and pinole a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables the tara humaras also eat small amounts of game fish and eggs their food contains approximately percent of total calories as fat of which the majority percent is of vegetable origin dietician martha mcmurry a coinvestigator in the study describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while low in cholesterol and fat the tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of mg dl lowdensity lipoprotein ldlcholesterol levels of mgdl and highdensity lipoprotein hdlcholesterol levels of to mgdl all of those values are in the good lowrisk range according to the researchers elevated cholesterol and ldlcholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april disease hdlcholesterol is considered beneficial in previous studies the tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease although able to respond to highcholesterol diets with elevations in total and ldlcholesterol clinical research center dietitian mcmurry and coinvestigator maria teresa cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a jesuit mission school building near a community hospital in the small village of sisoguichi food was weighed cooked and fed to the study participants under the investigators direct supervision ensuring that subjects ate only food stipulated by the research protocol fasting blood was drawn twice weekly and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to dr connors laboratory for cholesterol triglyceride and lipoprotein analyses regular measurements included participant body weight height and triceps skin fold thickness thirteen tarahumaras five women and eight men including one adolescent were fed their native diet for week followed by weeks of an affluent diet in this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was percent of total calories this is the prototype of the holiday diet that many americans consume a diet high in fat sugar and cholesterol low in fiber elaborates dr conners such dietary characteristics are reflected in the cholesterolsaturation index or csi recently devised research dietitian sonja conner working with dr connor the csi is a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in the diet csi indicates the diets potential to elevate the cholesterol level particularly the ldl dr connor explains the tarahumaran diet averages a very low csi of dr connors affluent diet used in the study ranks a csi of the experimental design of this study reflects the importance of establishing baseline plasma lipid levels typical of the native diet before exposing subjects to the experimental diet the standard curve relating dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off or plateau for consumption of large amounts of fat changes in dietary fat andor cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels you must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put into the experimental diet the framingham study for example did not discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease because the diet was already high in fat all subjects were already eating on a plateau dr connor says after weeks of consuming the affluent diet the subjects mean plasma cholesterol levels had in creased by percent primarily in the ldl fraction which rose percent hdlcholesterol increased by per cent and ldl to hdl ratios changed therefore very little plasma triglyceride levels increased by percent and subjects averaged an pound gain in weight according to dr connor lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon yielding nearly the same results after days of affluent diet as after days hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april the increase in hdl carries broad dietary implications for industrialized nations we think hdlcholesterol increased because we increased the amount of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous tarahumara metabolic study in that study we saw no change in hdl levels after raising the dietary cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption in the present study we increased fat intake to percent of the total calories we reached the conclusion in the tarahumara study that hdl reflects the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol hdl must increase to help metabolize the fat and it increased quite a bit in this study dr connor explains low hdl in the tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of fat or cholesterol hdl remains an important predictor to americans because of their usual high fat intake dr connor recommends a diet for americans that contains less than percent of total calories as fat less than mg of cholesterol and a csi around varying in accordance with caloric needs such a diet is low in meat and dairy fat high in fiber dr connor also comments on recent suggestions that americans adopt a mediterraneanstyle diet the original mediterranean diet in its pristine state consisted of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy products we are already eating a lot of meat and dairy products simply to continue that pattern while switching to olive oil is not going to help the situation the world health organization who is focusing much attention on the emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies undergoing technological development dr connor says that coronary heart disease starts with a given societys elite who typically eat a different diet than the average citizen if the pattern of afluence increases the entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease which places a termendous health care burden on a society who would like the developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease so they can concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public health measures to improve general wellbeing rather than paying for unnecessary expensive medical technology dr connors says the overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a highrisk range within a very short time by an affluent excessive diet the present rate of coronary heart disease in the united states is percent

advantages rather than disadvantages write franklin volvovitz and gale smith of microgenesys in meriden conn moore et al says that gp in a baculovirus expression system does not bind strongly to the cd receptor and that this recombinant gp does not stimulate the same antibodies as the hiv virus does in natural infection but vaccination with recombinant gp in patients infected with hiv broadens hiv specific envelopedirected immune responses including crossreactive antibodies to gp epitopes and cd and cd cytotoxic tcell responses volvovitz and smith claim that they never intended their gp molecule to be identical to the native protein antibody responses against native hiv proteins including the types described by moore et al exist in nearly all aids patients but do not prevent hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april progression of hiv disease in addition the binding of gp or gpantibody complexes to cd has been shown to interfere with antigen specific activation of cd cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro which may contribute to the pathogenesis of hiv infection the absence of cd binding by the microgenesys gp vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added safety feature phase i studies have demonstrated stable cd counts stimulation of cytotoxic t cells and the suggestion of restoration of immune function based on these and other clinical results

gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses in both normal and uninfected children born to hivpositive mothers the italian national registry of aids discovered that breastfed hiv infected children had a longer median incubation time months than bottlefed infants months breastfed children also had a slower progression to aids there is no agreement on which antibodies offer protection against hiv infection studies of the biological properties of milk from hiv infected women showed the presence of igg and iga antibodies against envelope glycoproteins as well as iga antibodies against core antigens binding of hiv to the cd receptor can be inhibited by a human milk factor in the developing world where infectious disease and malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality breast milk is still the best food for infants regardless of the mothers hiv status transmission might be restricted by breastfeeding after colostrum and early milk have been expressed and discarded the

analysis was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their hiv to that of the dentist death certificates were obtained for deceased patients and the medical records of those with diagnoses suggestive of hiv disease or drug abuse and those dying under the age of years were examined in detail there were patients who had undergone procedures of whom were deceased an examination of the death certificates of patients identified five who had died with hiv infection all of whom were either homosexuals or ivdrug users the researchers were able to detect of the remaining patients and agreed to be tested hiv infection was reported in five of the patients including four who had clear evidence of risk factors for the disease one patient who had only a single evaluation by the dentist denied highrisk behavior comparative dna sequence analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists and these five patients were not closely related the study suggests the potential for hiv transmission from a general dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in which universal precautions are strictly observed conclude dickinson et al april aids patients are susceptible to recurrences of tb study says washington post p a tuberculosis can strike aids patients more than once which makes the resurging health hazard harder to control according to a study published in todays new england journal of medicine people who contract tb usually develop an immunity that protects them if they are exposed to the bacteria again but a person whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight off a new tb infection doctors found peter m small of the howard hughes medical institute at stanford university director of the study said that in order to protect against reinfection it may be necessary for some people to use tb medicines permanently the study examined the genetic makeup of tb bacteria and how the germs changed over time in patients at kings county hospital in new

mok of the lancet the antiinfective properties of milk are well documented while the numbers of hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april leukocytes concentrations of lactoferrin and iga and lymphocyte mitogenic activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of lactation to barely detectable levels lactoferrin and iga then increase from three to twelve months with percent of total iga in milk being secretory iga breastfeeding protects infants against gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses in both normal and uninfected children born to hivpositive mothers the italian national registry of aids discovered that breastfed hiv infected children had a longer median incubation time months than bottlefed infants months breastfed children also had a slower progression to aids there is no agreement on which antibodies offer protection against hiv infection studies of the biological properties of milk from hiv infected women showed the presence of igg and iga antibodies against envelope glycoproteins as well as iga antibodies against core antigens binding of hiv to the cd receptor can be inhibited by a human milk factor in the developing world where infectious disease and malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality breast milk is still the best food for infants regardless of the mothers hiv status transmission might be restricted by breastfeeding after colostrum and early milk have been expressed and discarded the possibility remains that breast milk could protect the infant who is already infected with hiv at birth and may even delay progression to aids concludes mok hiv and the aetiology of aids lancet vol no p duesberg peter because there is no proof that hiv is the cause of aids the hypothesis that drug use leads to aids will hopefully become a hindrance to the physiologically azt and psychologically positive aids test toxic public health initiatives writes peter duesberg of the university of californiaberkeley in the lancets march issue schechter et al call duesbergs hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and azt lead to aids a hindrance to public health initiatives however their hypothesis that hiv is the cause of aids has not attained any public health benefits the us government spends billion annually but no vaccine no therapy no prevention and no aids control have resulted from work on this hypothesis schechter et al conclude that hiv has a key role in cd depletion and aids based on epidemiological correlations with antibodies against hiv and with self reported recreational drug use among homosexuals from vancouver however their survey neglects to disprove duesbergs drugaids hypothesis because it does not provide controlsie confirmed drugfree aids casesand because it does not quantify drug use and ignores azt use altogether to refute duesbergs hypothesis schechter would have to produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a period of up to years hivpositive patients who use recreational drugs or azt or both have the same aids risks as positives who do not do so the year period is claimed by hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april proponents of the hiv hypothesis to be the time needed for hiv to cause aids alternatively they could show that hivfree individuals who have used drugs for years never get aidsdefining illnesses concludes duesberg rapid

loss in some hiv infected individuals through the amplification of harmful autoimmune reactions write sandro vento et al of the a pugliese hospital in catanzaro italy the researchers report three asymptomatic hiv infected individuals with hepatitis c virus related chronic active hepatitis cah who had a rapid profound decline of cd cells after ifn all three patients throughout the observation were consistently negative for serum hiv p antigen and had circulating antibodies to p sera from all three patients obtained at the end of ifn treatment and testing in enzymelinked immunosorbent assay contained high titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human hla class ii antigens homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy terminus of hiv gp these autoantibodies which also recognize native class ii molecules and may contribute to the elimination of cd t cells in vivo were at low tires in all three patients six months after stopping ifn such autoantibodies were not detected in other patients with hiv infection and hcv related cah treated with ifn and who did not experience cd tcell loss in some hiv infected individuals through the amplification of harmful autoimmune reactions the subjects had a b dr and b dr hla antigen combinations which are linked with a more rapid fall in cd cell counts and clinical progression of hiv disease ifn can induce a very rapid decline of cd cells and should be used cautiously in patients with these hla haplotypes the researchers conclude april tb makes a comeback state government news vol

prisoners dr lee b reichman professor of medicine at the university of new jersey medical school and president of the american lung association said right now its a big city problem but potentially its everyones problem the ala predicts that million americans are infected with tb and about percent of them will develop the disease because their immune systems are depressed especially those with aids or hiv gene hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april tammes a centers for disease control expert said that is why the cdc has issued guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix aids with tb patients state health officials believe the tb is also spreading because those who are most susceptible are the least likely to follow through with treatment in addition the increase is attributed to a shortage of public health services in new york city tb is an epidemic because the number of cases is increasing faster than we can treat people said dr george diferdinando director of the new york state tb control according to diferdinando curbing the spread of tb entails keeping percent or more of diagnosed tb cases in treatment about percent of infected new york city residents

drug users or persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the primary route of hiv transmission medical records of patients in addition to records from social services hiv counseling and testing centers and sexually transmitted disease std clinics were reviewed if no other hiv risk factor was found from medical record review patients were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire once std clinic and other medical records were reviewed men and women were reclassified into other hiv transmission categories after adjustments were made for the reclassification the percentage of aids cases reported from palm beach and broward counties between january and march that was attributed to heterosexual transmission decreased from percent to percent among men and from percent to

bethesda md april absence of hiv transmission from an infected orthopedic surgeon journal of the american medical association vol no p von reyn c fordham the risk of hiv transmission from an hivpositive surgeon to patient is extremely low provided that the surgeon strictly adheres to universal infection control procedures write c fordham von reyn et al of the dartmouthhitchcock medical center in lebanon nh the researchers contacted former patients on whom an hivpositive orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures between january and june the orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after testing positive for hiv a total of former patients underwent hiv testing representing percent of patients on whom the orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures during the year period patients were tested from each year and from each category of invasive procedure all patients were found to be negative for hiv by enzymelinkedimmunosorbent assay two former patients reported known hiv infection prior to surgery the examination of aids case registries and vital records neglected to detect cases of hiv infection among former surgical patients the estimated cost of the initial patient notification and testing was with the single most expensive activity being counseling and testing this accounted for percent of the total expense the patient notification and testing were conducted while maintaining the confidentiality of the orthopedic surgeon who was an active participant in the planning and execution of the study notifying patients of the infected surgeons hivstatus is both disruptive and expensive and is not routinely recommended the researchers conclude investigation of potential hiv transmission to the patients of an hivinfected surgeon journal of the american medical association vol hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april no p smith rogers audrey et al the risk of hiv transmission during surgery is so remote that it will be quantified only by gathering data from multiple methodologically similar investigations writes audrey smith rogers et al of the johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore md the researchers identified a total of persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical procedures between and and for whom the hivpositive surgeon was listed as the operating surgeon the aids case registries were reviewed for all patients having undergone invasive procedures and death certificates were obtained among the patients were dead had no address had test results known and did not respond to the questionnaire no study patient name was found in reported aids case registries one newly detected hivpositive patient was determined to have been most probably infected in during a transfusion there was no hiv transmission in personhours of surgical exposure suggesting that hiv transmission to patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per personhours of surgical exposure the researchers determined there is no evidence to suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard infectioncontrol guidelines over percent of the patients with invasive procedures chose to be tested and of those whose results were revealed only one person was found to be infected with hiv the study patients infection was probably the result of a tainted blood transfusion received in as a result there is no evidence that the transmission of hiv from the hivpositive surgeon to any patient transpired the researchers conclude april drug concerns to share aids data new york times p c kolata gina a total of major pharmaceutical companies have decided in a highly unusual move to share aids drugs and information while the drugs are undergoing early clinical testing dr edward scolnick president of the merck research laboratory in rahway nj arranged the collaboration he said that cooperation between companies seemed increasingly significant as it had become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more effective in fighting hiv than any drug used alone the researchers are hopeful that hiv when faced with a combination of several drugs requiring mutation at different sites for resistance to develop will be unable to evolve all the mutations at the same time therefore several drugs taken together or one after the other could halt the spread of hiv currently the drug companies do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing the new agreement allows companies to routinely exchange animal data and safety data on new aids drugs an agreement like this will greatly facilitate hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april companies ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a much more efficient way said scolnick he also said that the collaboration would not violate antitrust laws in creating the agreement merck spoke frequently to members of aids advocacy groups including actup dr daniel hoth director of the division on aids at the national institute of allergy and infectious disease said were delighted to see the pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that increasing the information flow will likely accelerate the discovery of better compounds for aids related stories wall street journal p b philadelphia inquirer p a usa today p b the next step in aids treatment nature vol no p maddox john although azt was found to be ineffective in prolonging the lives of people infected with hiv the findings do not indicate that azt should not be administered in people with fullblown aids writes columnist john maddox azt has been used in the united states in asymptomatic hivpositive people on the basis that administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of tcell counts however a report in the lancet demonstrated that azt should not be used early in the course of disease while the cd counts of the people given azt were consistently greater than those of patients receiving only placebo the first three years of followup have shown that the proportions of people in the two groups progressing to overt aids or even to death were not significantly different at roughly percent the conclusions are that azt is not an effective aids drug in hivinfected individuals and that cd cell count may not be a reliable proxy for the progression to aids in infected people but nothing is implied by the study of the utility of azt in the treatment of those in whom symptoms have already appearedthere is no case for abandoning that treatment at least on the evidence now available it is much more alarming that the cd count has proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in hiv infection aids researchers should acknowledge hiv is alive from the beginning of infection and turn it into a workable assay of the progress of disease the general application of such an assay will probably in itself provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of aids concludes maddox infective and antiinfective properties of breastmilk from hivinfected women lancet vol no p van de perre philippe et al a vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of the igm type in the mothers body fluids could be valuable to prevent transmission of hiv from mother to child write philippe van de perre et al of the hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april national aids control program in kigali rwanda the researchers hypothesized that transmission of hiv through breastmilk could be favored by the presence of infected cells by deficiency of antiinfective substances in breastmilk or both factors a total of hivinfected women were enrolled at delivery in kigali rwanda milk samples were collected days months and months post partum hiv igg secretory iga and igm were assayed by western blot for the latter two after removal of igg with protein g in the day and month samples the researchers sought viral genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain reaction with three sets of primers gag pol and env at days months and months post partum hiv specific igg was detected in percent percent and percent of breastmilk samples iga in percent percent and percent and igm in percent percent and percent in children who survived longer than months the risk of infection was associated with lack of persistence of igm and iga in their mothers milk the presence of hivinfected cells in the milk days post partum was strongly predictive of hiv infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis the combination of hiv infected cells in breastmilk and a defective igm response was the strongest predictor of infection igm and iga antihiv in breastmilk may protect against postnatal transmission of hiv the researchers conclude april firms to share aids research in global venture journal of commerce p a a total of fifteen us and european pharmaceutical companies announced tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on earlystage aids research to hasten the search for combination therapies to fight hiv infection and aids the companies said the unusual move resulted primarily from the increasing concentration of aids research on combination therapies since realizing that hiv is likely to develop resistance to every individual aids drug edward scolnick president of merck co research laboratories led the collaborative effort that took a year of negotiations to come together said participants in addition to merck the other companies involved in the intercompany collaboration for aids drug development are bristolmyers squibb co burroughs wellcome glaxo inc hoffmanla roche eli lilly co pfizer inc smithkline beecham ab astra du pont merck syntex inc boehringer ingelheim miles inc and sigmatau the participants said that all companies involved in aids drug development they were aware of had joined the collaboration and that any company actively involved in hiv antiviral development may participate scolnick said the collaborators would most likely meet every couple of months for a daylong scientific meeting where they will review for one another their preclinical hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april and early clinical data the american foundation for aids research amfar was pleased with the news of the collaboration which it hopes will lead to the development of drug combinations that will reduce viral resistance related story financial times p guidance over hivinfected healthcare workers lancet vol no p horton richard the united kingdoms department of health recently followed the advice of aids experts that there is no scientific reason for routine hiv testing among healthcare workers following recent highly publicized reports of health professionals who contracted hiv the department issued revised guidelines on the management of such cases dr kenneth calman chief medical officer said doctors dentists nurses and other

responsesa from anyone with experience with rutin is there another newsgroup that a might have specifics on herbal remediesa a robert allison i tried to email you but our board is having internet problems so im not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not rutin is not a herb but part of the bioflavonoid complex you should generally not take rutin by itself but take the whole bioflavonoid complex instead if you dont and there are some exceptions to that youll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency which is the other major component of the bioflavonoid complex i found out the hard way years ago when i recommended rutin after it showed deficient in patients who were not deficient in hesperidin be fore a later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in hesperidin which from then on made me always add bioflavonoids to anyone that had very low levels of rutin most of the time people are equally low in rutin and hesperidin so there is really no reason to take rutin by itself but use the whole bioflavonoid complex instead i have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that they had been helped with hemorrhoids varicose veins chronic nose bleeds aneurysms gastrointestinal bleeding due to drugs etc one patient in desperation took a whole bottle s in one day for his painful bleeding hemorrhoids without any ill effects they are also nontoxic in very high amounts thats why they can be safely recommended if you are allergic to citrus fruit they are made from their peels pine bark sources are available as well about of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency with the average daily dosage needed being about mg for major complaints mgday is common in case they cannot be taken because of their size and taste they are big and they dont taste that great a product made from pine bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite small and taste much better however the cost is about seven times higher for the equivalent effect one mg tablet of the pine bark extract gives you about the same effect as mg of bioflavonoids the name for the pine bark product is pycnogenol some canadian brands carrying

effective particularly by itself primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug therapy the most current theories of this condition attribute it to more to biological causes than psychological in places where this distinction becomes important i mentioned that the dsmiiir mentions impulses as a possible diagnostic marker however this might look like somethingpeople associate with psychotic conditions uncontrollable orunpredictable behaviors which is not the case with ocd one of the diagnostic criteria of ocd is that the individualcan and does suppress some of their impulses although theyare an unending source of anxiety the obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with ocd are most frequently very mundane and predictable closer toa

the hallmarks of a quack david rindone of the responsibilities of a licensed physician is to read the medical literature to keep up with changes in medical practice all the clamor over laetril

treatments are available may deserve to be called a quack antifungals are in a different class the big question seems to be is it reasonable to use them in patients with gi distress or sinus problems that could be due to candida blooms following the use of broadspectrum antibiotics gorden rubenfeld through email has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broadspectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body i do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice he deals with critical care patients where fungal infectionsystemic is a real problem and just because he tries to keep good bacteria in his patients does not mean that all physicians do this i think that aspergillis is more likely to be found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida women have been known for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and not give give her advise to use the otc antifungal creams since candida colonizes primarily in the anorectal area gi symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broadspectrum antibiotic usethe problem we have here david is proof that gi discomfort can be caused by a candida bloom the arguement is that without proof no action is warrentedmedicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way there has always been the use of conventional wisdom a very good example is kidney stones conventional wisdombecause clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed through the recent new england j of medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intakethe conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapyif it makes sense for livestock why doesnt it make sense for humans david we are not talking about a dangerous treatmentunless you consider yogurt dangerous

othernew technology for hearing aidsthe resound system was developed on the basis of some research at att andappears to take a different approach from other aids it appears to me thata new programmable aid like the widex just uses a more flexible andprogrammable version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts ofthe spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and helpout in noisy situationsthe major difference in the resound approach is that it divides thespectrum into low and high frequencies splitting point is programmableapparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found inthe low frequencies while the important consonant informationunfortunately for me is in the high frequencies the two bands then aretreated with different compression schemes which are programable they havealso developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they callabnormal growth of loudnessthis latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience though ithink the phrase is missleading what appears to be the case is that as youexceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss the deficitbecomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reachthe too loud point the sensitivity curves appear to converge this meansthat if you just boost all sound levels you are overloading at the highend for people with hearing losses hence what you want is progressivelyless amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable pointyou want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentiallydifferently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum speciallyfor someone like me who is relatively normal up to cps and then fallsoff a cliffaids with simple compressors dont descriminate between energy in the lowand high frequencies and can therefor compress useful high frequencyinformation because of high volume of low frequency componentsparticularly impressive was the

only medical schools in the us teach courses on human nutrition we have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical

other minerals i think that there have been some deaths when edta chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that were not detected and corrected in animal studies the best way to remove calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin c and magnesiumrabbits already synthesize their own vitamin c the extra vitamin c was given in their diets to help the

membranes can occur after antibiotic use this has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome the quack diagnosis that has been being discussed found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida women have been known for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and not give give her advise to use the otc antifungal creams lucky how since a recent article randomized controlled trial of oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis ive mentioned to a number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they could try eating ounces of yogurt daily it turns out most would rather just use antifungal creams when they get yeast infections yogurt dangerous if this were a standard part of medical practice as gordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline again this just isnt what the systemic yeast syndrome is about and has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed there is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the gi tract with bacteria after antibiotic therapy dont seem to be very helpful in reducing diarrhea but i dont think anyone would view this as a quack therapy david rindyogurt contains lactobacillus acidophilus and l bulgaricus l acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free most of the commercial yogurt sold in the us has a very low l acidophilus and l bulgaricus count neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem gordon r has told me through email that he gives his patients l acidophilus and several different obligate anaerobeswhich setup shop in the colon but he hasnt told me which ones yet the lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative anaerobes and will setup shop where they have access to oxygen if given a chancemouth anus sinus cavity and vagina having these good bacteria around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal region or the vagina i have not proposed a systemic action for candida blooms i know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from the evil yeast blooms in the body im not ready to buy that yet i do believe that complications at specific sitesvagina anal and maybe lower colon sinus and mouth can result from antibiotic use which removes the competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow uncheckedrestoring the right bacterial balance is the best wayin my opinion to get rid of the problem antifungals a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin a supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the good bacteria

environment in which corrections officers must workearlier this month an afscme corrections officer robertvallandingham was killed by inmates who overtook the correctionsfacility in lucasville ohio the law and order agenda of the s has resulted in a steadyincrease in the prison population for the past five years onjn the prison population was projectionsshow a continued increase in the number of inmates with anexpected prison population of in the conditions which this burgeoning prison population hascreated for corrections officers is partially reflected in thenumber of assaults by inmates against staff assaults againststaff increased dramatically between and and remainhigh in there were assaults by inmates against staffcompared to such assaults in the increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerouscombination of overcrowding and understaffing for example in ohioofficertoinmate ratio is to the second worst ratio inthe nation the national average is to other health

facilities correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs underlifethreatening conditions every year american workersdie from jobrelated injuries and tens of thousands more die fromoccupational disease public employees do some of the nationsmost dangerous jobs perilous occupations include highway workers highway workers are often injured and frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are not barricaded or dont have proper lighting health care workers hospitals have the highest number of jobrelated injuries and illnesses of any private sector employer and nursing homes ranked fifth there were more than jobrelated illnesses and injuries in private sector hospitals in up almost percent over the previous year it is generally believed that health care workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses than do their private sector counterparts health and safety issues facing health care workers include exposure to tuberculosis and the hiv virus back injuries and high levels of stress social workers social workers who work in mental health institutions are often the victims of assaults and sometimes fatal attacks for instance last october a man carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the schuyler county social services building in watkins glenn ny and fatally shot social services workers before turning the gun on himself there are two basic problems first is a growing lack of support services for people who dont have the help they need because workers are overworked some clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated the quality of the clients is also becoming more violent as more are moved out of the institutions nearly million workers have been killed by workplace hazardssince osha was passed moreover as afscme president gerald wmcentee explains osha does not provide workplace safetyprotections for public employees more than public employees are killed each year on thejob yet states still provide no federallyapproved oshacoverage for public employees said mcentee this despite thefact that public employees highway workers health care workerscorrections officers to name but a few do some of the mostdangerous work in our society this year we are fighting forpassage of osha reform legislation to give all workers greaterrights and protections and finally guarantee all public employeessafe workplaces we need the public support to be successful government workers suffer percent more injuries than privatesector workers and these injuries are almost percent moresevere public employees were exempted from osha when the law was passedin and today public

nodroghardyuwashingtonedu gordon rubenfeld writes marty youve also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiricitraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemichypersensitivity symptoms noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamintherapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome withsystemic symptoms there is significant difference between the cost andrisk of these two empiric therapeutic trials are we talking about realcandida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficacyof routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotallyeffective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confirman etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc we cant seem tofocus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion im lostpoint im beginning to see that part of the disagreements about the wholeyeast issue is on differing perceptions and on differing meaningsof words medical doctors have a very specific and specialized jargonnecessary for precise communication within their field which im fullycognizant of since i too speak jargonese when with my peers for thesituation in scimed many times the words or phrases used by doctors canhave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in theworld at large causing significant miscommunication one example wordand very relevant to the yeast discussion is the exact meaning of systemicit is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific muchmore so than its meaning to a nondoctor there is also the observation ofthis newsgroup that both doctors and nondoctors come together on essentiallyequal terms which when combined with the jargon issue can further fanthe flames this is probably the first time that practicing doctors getreally beat up by nondoctors for their views on medicine which theyotherwise dont see much of in their practice except for the occasionaldifficult patientpoint i understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will notprescribe any treatmentstherapies for their patients unless such treatmentshave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from wellconstructedclinical trials usually doubleblind or that such treatmentstherapies arepart of an approved and funded clinical trial to these doctors to do anydifferently would in this belief system be unethical practice and itfollows that any therapy not on the accepted list is therefore a nontherapy it does not even exist nor does the underlying hypothesis ortheory have any validity even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolationof what is currently known anecdotal evidence has no value either froma treatment pointofviewand by and large as a scientist myself i am glad that medical practicescience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment however asalso being a human being last i checked and having been one of those peoplethat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment wherestandard medicine was not able to help me has caused me to sit back andwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid scientific viewpoint is initself unethical from humanitarian considerations after all the underlyingintent of the scientific approach to medicine is to protect the health ofthe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient so thepatient should come first when considering treatmentwhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies boththe scientific and the humanitarian viewpoints in an earlier post ioutlined a crazy idea for doing just that the gist of it was to give anyphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribealternate not yet proven therapies maybe supported by anecdotal evidencefor patients who all avenues of accepted therapies have been exhaustedand not until then the patient would be fully informed that suchtherapiestreatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and thatthere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derivedfrom themthis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor it also satisfiesthe humanitarian needs of the patient and the reality is that many patientswho have reached a deadend in the treatment of their symptoms using acceptedmedicine will go outside the orthodox medical community either to thedoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losingtheir license or worse to nondoctors who have not had the proper medicaltraining this approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the controlmore within orthodox medicine with the benefits that the information gleanedcould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the mostproductive way everybody wins in this admittedly rosecolored approach imsure there are real problems with this approach as well it is presentedmore as a strawman to stimulate discussionhopefully what i write here may give the scimed doctors a better idea as towhy i am open to alternative therapies as well as why i have realdifficulty read apparent hostility with the coldness of the purescientific approach to medicine i believe the best approach to medicaltreatment is one where both the humanitarian aspects are balanced with andby the scientific aspects anything else is just not good medicine imhojust my nf leanings i guess commentsjon noring charter member infj clubif youre dying to know what infj means be brave email me ill send info jon noring

keep me roughly functional but leave a lot to be desired recently i had an opportunity to test the widex q behind the ear aids for several weeks these have four independent programs which are intended to be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed i found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system called resound unfortunately i was only able to try the resound aids in their office for about minutes and i couldnt compare them head to head with the widex nevertheless it did appear to me that they were superior and i was impressed by what i was able to read about the theory behind them which i will give in a separate posting they also carry the widex aids and had one patient presumably wealthy who decided to go ahead and get the resound even though he had purchased the widex only months ago the problem is that the resound aids are about twice as expensive as the widex and other programmable aids i could take a trip to europe on the difference being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money i am having a hard time persuading myself to go with the resounds i would appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections about when and if i might see improvements in technology that arent quite so expensive

finding would not have been too informativethis is often the reason why lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are recommended rather than yogurti guess the next question is why would this introduction of good bacteria back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the anus was not serving as a candida reservoira fact that gordon r vehementydenys i see two possible theories one the l acidophilus which is a facultatively anaerobic bacterium could make it through the gut and colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida this would not explain the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion was stopped though the other is that the additional bacteria in the intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida looses its major food sourcegetting lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tractwhere it is normally found would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal yeast blooms though an acetic acid lactobacillus acidophilus douche has been used to get this effect but ive not seen any such treatment reported in the medical literature this would be an example of physicians conducting their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their patients when this is done in private practice the results are rarely if ever published it was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age emerged with clinical trials it really raises a big question does the medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to help patients or does it look the other waythis particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous therapy is involvedeven the antifungals are not all that dangerous but there are some areaslike edta chelation therapy where the fire is pretty hot and somebody could get burned its really tough do i follow only well established protocols and then give up if they dont work that well or do it try something that looks like it will work but hasnt been proven to work yetmy stand is to consider other treatment possibilities especially if they involve little or no risk to the patient getting good bacteria back into the

not a frequent reader of either groupi will summarize to the netim very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcisionof newborn males on the population since your friend is not a man shemoney probably has a lot to do with keeping the practice of routine circumcision alive its another opporitunity to charge a few hundredextra bucks for a completely unnecessary procedure the rationale for which until recently has been accepted without question by mostparents of newborns one could also imagine that complications arising from circumcisioninfections sloppy jobs etc are far more common than the remote chanceof penile cancer it is purported to prevent cant imagine what its like to have a penis much less a foreskin iguess if american medicine did an artistic job of

standard mri equipment fitted with specialsoftware developed at hmri called clinical proton mrs clinicalproton mrs is easily applied giving doctors confirmatory diagnosesin less than minutes an automated version of clinical protonmrs called proton brain examination probe reduces the examinationtime yet further providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than minutes by comparison the current standard of care in testingfor alzheimers disease calls for lengthy memory function andneuropsychological tests which can be very upsetting to thepatient are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy in addition to alzheimers disease the new clinical proton mrsexam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias includingaidsrelated dementia parkinsons disease and huntingtonsdisease weve developed a simple test which can be administered quicklyand relatively inexpensively using existing mri equipment fittedwith either the mrs or probe software said dr ross addingthis will help physicians to diagnose alzheimers earlier andintervene with therapeutics before the progression of the diseasecauses further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain dr ross and his hmri team measured a family of chemicals in thebrain known as inositols and myoinositol mi acted as a markerin the study in comparison to healthy patients those diagnosedwith alzheimers showed a percent increase in mi while theirlevel of another chemical called nacetylaspartate naa wassignificantly lower indicating a loss of brainstimulating neuronsbelieved to be associated with the progression of the disease current drug therapy for alzheimers disease is widelyconsidered to be inadequate this is attributable dr rossbelieves to the theory that alzheimers is caused by aninterruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine tothe nerve cells this belief has been adhered to over the last years and consequently most drugs to treat alzheimers were basedon the changing receptors for acetylcholine physicians have a real need for a test to differentiatealzheimers from other dementias to provide the patient and his orher family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatmentprotocols for the treatment of this disease for this reason weconsider this test a major advancement in medicine said brucemiller md a noted neurologist at harborucla mrs researcherand a

identified advanced age and genetic predisposition the riskof developing ad is less than one percent before the age of yars old but increases steeply in each successive decade of lifeto reach percent

appreciatedthanksyouve asked a toughie of a question there are many different drugs whichare used for chemotherapythe overall purpose of chemotherapy dont worry about the spelling some ofthese crazy medical words are impossible to spell is to either destroycancer cells or to keep them from growing different drugs have differenteffects on cancer cells and therefore it is not uncommon to use more thanone drug at a timesome chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycleof a cell others work only at specific times during the cell cyclethe first phase of the cell cycle is g it is when the protein synthesisand rna systhesis occurs in the second phase s synthesis of dna occursthe third phase is g the dna splits and rna and protein are synthesized aagain in the fourth phase m or mitosis the cell may dividethere are drugs which are effective in each phase some stop dna synthesisothers stop the cell from dividing others wreck protein synthesisat any rate the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cellsto stop growingif what you are seeking is practical advice i apologize for ramblingon the techno stuff some side effects are pretty common chemo drugsare rather nasty it can cause a person to lose their appetite and to experience nausea and vomiting things to help this include eating smallfrequent meals it is also suggested that if nauseavomiting hereafterknown as nv occurs that the person notify the doctor there are medicinestthat help nausea diarrhea can be an effect antidiarrheal medications can be given and good skincare and fluid intake are importantprobably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss this does not alwayshappen it depends on what drugs are being given and on the person themself different people taking the same drug can and do have differentside effects i have seen some literature which states that wearing a snugheadband andor wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss presumablyby reducing blood flow to the scalp

ultrasonic blasts tob breakdown the stone once it formed through the recent new england j ofb medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrongb increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than isb restricting calcium intake b marty b marty i personally wouldnt be so quick and take that nejm article on kidney stones as gospel first of all i would want to know who sponsored that study i have seen too many nutrition bulletins over the years from local newspapers magazines to tvguide with disclaimers on the bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us compliments of the dairy industries there are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous benefits of increasing ones calcium intake secondly were all the kidney stones of the test subjects involved in that project analysed for their chemical composition the study didnt say that it only claimed that most kidney stones are large ly calcium perhaps it wont be long before another study comes up with the exact opposite findings a curious phenomenon with researchers is that they are oftentimes just plain wrong it wouldnt be the first time sodiummagnesiumcalciumphosphorus ratios are in my opinion still the most reliable indicators for the cause treatment and prevention of kidney stones i for one will continue to recommend the most logical changes in ones diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney stones of either type and they definitely wont include an increase in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium type and peoples chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit from a phosphorusraising approach instead ron roth internet

her most recent doctors appointment at her parents hmo clinic she said that about forty xrays were made of her kidney when she asked why so many xrays were being made she was told by a technician that they need to see the area from different views but she says that about five xrays were made from each angle she couldnt help feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something she is a premed student and feels she could have understood what was happening if someone would have explained when nobody would she got worried also she is told that thre are surgery patients ahead of her and that they cannot do surgery until august or so it is now april she is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids but she has to go to classes she wonders why they have given her no medicine she plans to call back her doctors office clinic and try to get answers to these questions but i told her i would also write in to scimed and see what i could find out about why there were so many xrays and whether it seems ok to wait in line or more months for surgery for something like this or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care she does plan to get a second opinion too i will pass info on to her it never hurts to get information from more than one source you can email me or post thanks alicemy opinionfor what its worth is that xrays is way too many guidleines have been set on

from a severe depression brought on by menopause as well as a mental break down she is being treated with halydol with some success but the treatments being provided through her psychiatrist are not satisfactory someone suggested contacting a nutritionist to discuss alternative treatment since she is sensitive to medication i think this is a good suggestion but dont know where to begin if anyone can suggest a philly area nutritionist or else some literature to read id appreciate it lidai can emphasize with your situation both my wife and i suffered from bouts of depression hers was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and chemotherapy lida i used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through her six months of chemotherapywith the approval of her oncologist when severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped i tried to use supplements to bring her out of it i had cured her pms using supplements and i really thought that i knew enough about the role of diet in depression to take care of her depression as well it didnt work and she was put on prozac by her oncologist two winters agothree years after by wifes breast cancer i got hit with severe depressionpretty typical and one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another stressor i tried to take care of it for several months with supplementation didnt work my internist ended up putting me on prozac i was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using b niacin folate and b to cure depression im not going to do that because all you would be doing is flying blind like i waslida i do believe that depression can have a dietary component but the problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use an approach which will fix the problem for chemotherapy i knew exactly what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be affected same thing for pms i was flying blind for both of these stressors but the literature that i used to devise a treatment program was pretty good depression is just too complicated what you really need is a nutritional scan this is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your bodies nutrient reserves for every vitamin and mineralexcept vitamin c you have a reserve the rda is not designed to give you enough of any nutrient to keep these reserves full it is only designed to keep them from being emptied which would cause clinical pathology stress will increase your need for many vitamins and minerals this is when your reserves become very importantlida without your permission im going to use your post as a conduit to try to explain to the readers in this group and sci med where im coming from i have taught a course on human

is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that i need to make my education program complete this lab will let me measure the nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to be required in humans the mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to design supplement programs for their cancer patients cancer treatment centers of america which is a private forprofit organization with hospitals in illinois and oklahomatulsa also operates a nutritional assessment clinical lab i also believe that the pritikin clinic in california has a similiar lab setupfor physicians reading this post i would suggest that you get the new clinical nutrition textbook that has just been publishedfeb by mosby i have been using alpers manual of nutritional therapeuticsa little brown series book as a supplemental text for my course but alpers is geared more to residency training two mds have written this new clinical nutritiontextbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a patients nutritional status let me quote a few sentences from the preface of this new textsocalled nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists hematologists or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge of nutrition as it related to their field of practice unfortunately about two thirds of the medical schools in the united states require no formal instruction in nutritionbut times and medical practice have changed more than half of the leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives it should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of nutrition to your medical practice and it should heighten your awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially every organ systemroland l weinsier md drph lida my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and mineralsyes even magnesium may play a role in depression play in depression and who could get a nutritional profile run menopause is often a time when women suffer depression there are a lot of hormonal changes that are occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during pms a nutritionist may also be able to help not too long ago a poster mentioned that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red cell glutathionine peroxidase testthe specific test for the selenium reserve most clinical labs will not run this test and i advised him to try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified there are also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral analysis but these labs are not regulated checks of these labs using certified standards and also those doing water lead analysis showed some pretty shoddy testing was going on if you or anyone else finds someone who will run these speciality nutrition tests make sure that they are using a lab that has been certified under cliathe clinical laboratory improvement act a diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging and software analysisnutritionist iv and other software programs but there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve statusuntil we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the us and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses diet changes and supplementation antidepressants will probably continue to be the best approach to depressionmartin banschbach phdprofessor of

the tip of the syringe helps to have someone else do this and firmly expell the solution depending on the size of the syringe and thetenacity of the wax this could take several rinses if you place a bowl under the ear to catch the water it will be much drier you can buya syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy or just use whateveryou may have if wax is old it will be harder and darker

wisdombecause clinical trails have not been b done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the b intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones b from forming clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to b breakdown the stone once it formed through the recent new england j of b medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong b increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is b restricting calcium intake b marty b marty i personally wouldnt be so quick and take that nejm article on kidney stones as gospel first of all i would want to know who sponsored that study i have seen too many nutrition bulletins over the years from local newspapers magazines to tvguide with disclaimers on the bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us compliments of the dairy industries there are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous benefits of increasing ones calcium intake secondly were all the kidney stones of the test subjects involved in that project analysed for their chemical composition the study didnt say that it only claimed that most kidney stones are large ly calcium perhaps it wont be long before another study comes up with the exact opposite findings a curious phenomenon with researchers is that they are oftentimes just plain wrong it wouldnt be the first time sodiummagnesiumcalciumphosphorus ratios are in my opinion still the most reliable indicators for the cause treatment and prevention of kidney stones i for one will continue to recommend the most logical changes in ones diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney stones of either type and they definitely wont include an increase in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium type and peoples chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit from a phosphorusraising approach instead ron rothron you are absolutely right not all kidney stones have calcium and not all calcium stones are calciumoxalate but the vast majority are calciumoxalate calcium is just one piece of the puzzle i cited that nejm article as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that conventional wisdom is used in medicine always has been and probably always will be if one uses conventional wisdom there is a chance that you will be wrong as long as the error is not going to cause a lot of damage whats the big dealwhy call a physician who gives antifungals to sinus suffers or gi distress patients a quackon the kidney stone problem id want a mineral profile run in a clinical chemistry lab balance is much more important than the dietary

nutrition where i do most of my posting to avoid seeing a doctor nothing can be further from the truth kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to be ruled out but once it is diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurancesame thing with heart disease and cancer if you suspect that you may have a problem with one of these diseases dont use what im going to tell you or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor you have to gohopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment programbut the odds are that you will not and thats why im here when my wife detected a lump in here breast i didnt say dont worry my vitamin e will take care of it any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician plan and simple if its begninwhich most are fine then maybe a diet change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuringbut let me tell you right now if you have tried diet and supplementation and another lump returns get your butt into the doctors office as fast as your little feet can carry youbetter yet have a mammography done on a regular basis my wife kept putting hers off both myself and her gynocologist told her she needed to have one done her gynocologist even scheduled one but she didnt show uptoo busy running the operating room for the biggest hospital in tulsaone more thing i am not an orthomolecular nutritionist this group uses high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have drug actions in the body but you talk about flying blind man this is really blind treatment no drug could ever be used as these vitamins and minerals are being used im not saying that some of this stuff couldnt be right on the money it may well be but my approach to nutrition is a lot like that of weinsier and morgan the two mds who wrote the new clinical nutrition textbook my push is the nutrient reserves and the lab tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you handle stress thats where im coming from folks blast away if you wantim not going to change put me in your killfile if you want i really dont care im averaging email messages a day from people who think that ive got something important to say but im also getting hit by a few with an axe to grind thats lifechromium is one of the trace elements it has a very limitedbut very important role in the body it is used to form glucose tolerance factorgtf gtf is made up of chromium nicinamideniacin glycine cysteine and glutamic only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to form gtf some foods already have gtfliver brewers or nutritional yeastand black pepper when chromium is in gtf a pretty good absorption is seenabout but when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral chelatechromium picolinate its absorption is much lower to lowest for all the minerals ive been posting in misc fitness and chromium has come up there several times as a fat burner chromium is among the least toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really do any harm i wouldnt do it though the adequate and safe range for chromium is to ug per day the average american is getting about ug per day from hisher diet chromium levels decrease with age and many believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency i can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in type ii diabetes but im not going to because for each positive one there also seems to be a negative one as well im convinced that the problem is bioavailability when yeastgtf is used good results are obtained but when chromium itself is used the results are usually negative in addition to type ii diabetes chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and glucoma again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is concernedsince a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease this possible link with chromium isnt too surprising glucoma is a little more interesting muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin responsive glucosedriven metabolic function if this eye focusing activity is impairedby a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response intraocular pressure is believed to be elevated in a fairly large study of pts with glaucoma the one consistent finding was a low rbc chromium j am coll nutr but this one preliminary study should not prompt people to go out and start popping chromium supplements for one thing just about every older person is going to have a low rbc chromium unless they have been taking chromium suppleemntsyeast since glucoma is often found in older people its not too surprising that chromium was low in the rbcs if chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma that would prompt some attention i suspect that there will be a clinical trail to check out this possible chromium link to glucomayou could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the rbc chromium test or hair analysis most clinical labs are not going to run a rbc chromium there are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail analysis for you but i wouldnt use them there is just too much funny business going on in these unregulated labs right nowheres weinsier and morgan advise on chromium they do not consider chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is availablethey dont like the hair and nail analysis labs either and they also recognize the rbc chromium is primarily a research test that is not routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs this has to change and as more labs run a rbc chromiuum it will what then do they suggestmake a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical response to chromiumrun a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium supplementation once you make the diagnosis put the patient on ug of crcl orally each day or grams of yeast per daywhats my advise dont take chromium supplements to try to loose weightthey just do not work that way if you want to take them and then exercise that would be great do include yeast as part of your dietmost americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet if you do have a poor glucose tolerance ask your doctor to check your chromium status when he or she says what in the world are you talking about just say please get a copy of weinsier and morgans new clinical nutrition textbook and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose tolerance if you cant do that ill find a doctor who

at night is alsopretty long ranging from min to an hour i get about hours ofbedtime maybe of actual sleep a night and more on the weekends iwill spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if i can becausei feel so tired when i wake up even more tired than i was when iwent to bed which is usually too tired to workanyway i recently had a really bad flu so i called a friend toget me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestantbut he got vicks formula m which has everything but an expectorant soi used that anyway and the three nights i used it i fell asleep rapidlyand felt that i got really good quality sleep that is i actuallyfelt refreshed the next morningso i am now trying to look into both in the literature andexperimentally the use of antihistamines as sleep aids since i ampresuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect theantihistamine in vicks formula is chloriphenamine maleate so i boughtsome generic tablets of that and tried one last night and didntnotice any improvement i might try one with a little alcohol about beer to see if it is a synergism effect also library researchseems to show that benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongestsedative effect of what is availible otc so i might also buy a genericform of that and try that the pdr seems to suggest that mg is a gooddosage level to tryfor other medical information i have allergies but rarely havean allergic reaction living in new mexico i also have chronically dryeyes which get horrible if i try to use most underarm deoderants i didguess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia so i made somechanges in my diet consistent with that and it didnt help so iwent back to a normal diet pretty diverse also taking vitamin supplementsanyway i am looking for advice for the use ofantihistamines as sleep aids and if there are any dangers of such useseems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies bymillions i dont want to try bzs because bz addiction seems to bea serious threat and from what i hear bz sleep quality is not goodwhereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me i havetried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff

posted your biological alchemy discussion ive been compared to the famous robert mcelwaine by some readers of sci medi didnt know how to respond since i had not seen one of your postsjust like i havent read the yeast connectionlet me just start by stating that the authors of the cold fusion papers of recent years are now in scientific exilei believe that one has actually left the country scientific fraud is rare im still not sure that if a review of the research notes of the cold fusion scientists actually proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentationyour sources do not seem to be research articles they are more like lay texts designed to pique human interest in a subject areajust like the food combining and life extension texts robert i try to keep an open mindbut some things i just cant buyone is taking sod orally to prevent oxidative damage in the bodyyour experiment if conducted by readers of this news group would prove that you are rightmore ash after seed sprouting than before unless you use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperatureabove degrees i believe you will get organic residue in the ash even the residue in commercial incinerators contains organic residue i remember doing this kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in college but i couldnt find a temperature for mineral ash formation so im really guessing at degrees f it may actually be much higher the point is that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to produce only a mineral ash they also could not measure the minerals so they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct chemical reactions abound in our body in our atmosphere in our water and in our soil are these fusion reactions yes many of them do involve fusing oxygen nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics do we really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with silicon not in my book robertsilicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet ive seen speculation that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon based lifeform i like reading science fiction as many people do but i know enough about biochemistryand nutrition to be ablein most cases to separate the fiction from the factsilicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in humans we have several grams of the stuff in our body whats it doing there only the lord knows right now but i will tell you what i do know about silicon and why as you state it helps bone healingand it is not because silicon is transformed into calciumalmost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective tissuecollagen and elastin there have been studies published which show that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective factor against atherosclerosisthe higher the silicon content in elastin the more resistant the elastin is to a an agerelated loss of elasticity which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as part of the ageing process in humansfor bone fracture healing the first step is a collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts a high level of silicon in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation this first step in the bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get goingelectriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in the gapor gaps between the ends of the broken bone a vitamin c deficiencyby slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of defective collagen does slow down both bone and wound healing zinc is also another big player in bone and wound healing and so is siliconin an undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not transformation of silicon to calcium for you to take this bone healing observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into calcium is an interesting little trickbut robert i have the same problem myself when i read the lay pressand yes even some scientific papers is the explanation reasonable without a very good science knowledge base you and most readers of this news group are flying blindyou have to take it on faith because you dont know any betterif the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base im inclined to consider itthis usually means trying to find other sources that come to the same conclusion if the idealike a candida bloom seems to make sense to me i tend to pursue it as long as any advice that im going to give isnt going to really mess somebody up if this makes us kindred souls robert then i guess ill have to

digging through all my references is very time consumingtook me all day for that pms post im not going to cite any referencesgordon r has them im going to include some of the material from weinsier and morgans new nutrition textbookwhich was not in my original material to point out that what im going to say has some support in the medical communitydiet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very very long time protein has always had the biggest role in infection and ive already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infectionnow im going to hit what i consider to be the most important nutrient in the us as far as infection is concernedvitamin awhen vitamin a was originally discovered it was commonly referred to as the antiinfection vitamin many peoplelinus pauling being one have decided to take this title away from vitamin a and give it to vitamin cwhich ive already covered big mistakein my opinion vitamin a is also getting a reputation as an anticancer vitaminwith good reasonthe nci currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if vitamin a can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well its role in both cancer and infection is almost identicalbut not quitevitamin a comes in two completely different formsretinol and betacarotene retinol is the animal form and its toxic betacarotene is the plant form and its completely nontoxic both retinol and betacarotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present the liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding proteinrbp a normal human adult liver should have iu to iu of retinol stored we are born with iu in our liver us autopsy has shown that about of americans die with the sameor less amount of vitamin a as they were born with if you dont believe that nutritional reserveslike that of retinol in the liver are important then this low vitamin a reserve is not going to affect you but if you believelike i do that the nutrient reserves are important then there is a problem with vitamin a in the usthe us rda for vitamin a in an adult male is re or iu of vitamin a for adult feamles its re or iu of vitamin a diet surveys show that most americans are getting this amount of vitamin aeither retinol or betacarotene from their diet but the nrcnational research council was going to release a new rda table in that had the rda for both vitamin a and vitamin c raisedc to mg per day and a to iu per day for adult males that report and its recommendations was killed why concern over the increasing supplementation was the main reason rdas are set to prevent clinical disease not to keep nutrient reserves full many scientist in the us feel that the time has come to move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move towards the promotion of optimum health concept especially since we have some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely important during periods of stress the nutritonal concervatives won that battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the rda list which lowered the rda for several nutrients and moved the dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the sget enough to prevent clinical pathology but not enough to fill the reserveswe know from autopsy that only about of americans have a liver with a normal vitamin a reserveiu to iu i preach nutrient reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patientsbut for vitamin a only a liver biopsyor autopsy data will tell you how much somebody has stored we can tell very easily if someone has overfilled his or her liver with vitamin a by measuring the serium retinol levellevels above ugdl are highly suggestive that you have filled your liver with vitamin a and its time to stop taking retinol the normal range of serum retinol will be ugdl hypervitaminosis a is diagnosed with a serum retinol level of ugdl or higherinterpretation of diagnostic test wallach md a little brown series book this level of vitamin a in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to vitamin a toxicity weinsier and morgan take a much more conservative approach to vitamin a toxicity than does wallach as you will see later in this post between ugdl and ugdl you should have plenty of warning that its time to eliminate the retinol from your dietheadache redness of the skin hair loss joint paini tell all my students that will use vitamin a in their practice that they had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear signs that the liver is full you will never really know if the patient needs the vitamin abecause you can not measure the pool in liver but you will always know when its time to stopjust like in those vitamin a for pms studiesbetacarotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of betacarotene to retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow downstops in the liver and slows down in the gut when your liver is full of retinol but taking betacarotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to fill the liver upive seen estimates of years if you are in the that only has as much as you were born with in your liveriu one other problem with betacarotene if you have a zinc deficit you will not convert as much betacarotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc in addition the release of retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will cause a vitamin a deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin anow what does vitamin a do in cancer and infection protection the body uses vitamin aretinol for many different things visionthe first to be nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology uses the aldehyderetinal and alcoholretinol form of vitamin a reproduction uses the retinol form and some retinal infection and cancer protection uses retinoic acid how do you convert retinolwhich your white blood cells and the mucosal cells get from blood to retinoic acid you use enzymes one of which requires vitamin cthis is why pauling has tried to pull the title of antiinfection vitamin away from vitamin a vitamin c does play a role in infectioninterferon production for example but its biggest role is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid if you increase your intake of vitamin c you will increase your formation of retinoic acid but retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinolas retinal can and once its formed its used and then lost to the body this is why the nrc group wanted to increase both vitamin c and vitamin a rdasmost people taking large amounts of vitamin c really think that they are helping themselves if they dont have much vitamin a in their liver and they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin a they actually do themselves more harm than goodretinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formationin the mucus membrane it is the main factor in promoting good mucus production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from entering the blood system the mucus membrane is referred to as the first line defense against infection for cancer retinoic acid has been shown to act as a cell brakeit counteracts the effect of cell promoters which stimulate cells to divide cancer has two distinct steps dna alteration and cell promotion for cells that normally divide all the time promoters are not that important but for lung and breast tissue which does not normally divide promoters are real important in the malignant processthis is the major reason why the nci has so many different clinical trials in progress using retinol andor betacarotenechronic infectionirritation of the mucus membranes is a signal that vitamin a may not be adequate i tell my students that any patient who walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be worked up for vitamin aalong with the other factors that medicine already has on its list of causes for chronic infection i drive this home in my course at the osteopathic college in tulsa when i teach at the allopathic medical school in tulsaous branch campus and when i give cme lecturesdark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin a status since night vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to iu of retinol the serum level of retinol can also be used but it does not drop until liver reserves drop below to iu asking a patient if they have trouble seeing at night is a good initial screenif cataracts are ruled out in one study done on us spanishamericans where serum retinol levels were measured of the sample population had a serum retinol level below ugdlas more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of the us that have had a history of high infection rates we will probably see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low serum retinol levelswhat do weinsier and morgan have to say about vitamin a here are excerptsfrom their bookvitamin a functions in vision in the forrm of retinol it is necessay for growth and differentation of epithelial tissue and is required for reproduction embryonic development and bone growth proteincalorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption transport and metabolism of vitamin a retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not in reproduction or vision the most common procedure to evaluate vitamin a status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum the normal range for vitamin a content for a child is to ugdl lower values are indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores serum levels greater than ugdl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin a dark adaptation tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to perform on young children rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to vitamin a deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state the bronchorespiratory tract skin genitourinary system gastrointestinal tract and sweat glands are adversely affected a daily intake of more than mgabout iu of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts over mgiu can result in a dry and itching skin desquamation erythematous dermatitis hair loss joint pain chapped lips hyperostoisbony depositis headaches anorexia edema and fatigue they recommend mg of retinol via im injection in children for vitamin a deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults their toxic serum retinol level is very conservative i recommend that my students try iu in adults that are having problems with chronic infection they have to rule out a zinc deficit first by getting an rbc zinc runor if their clinical lab cant run it i tell them to do what weinsier and morgan suggest give them the zinc along with the vitamin a at iu per day toxicity should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinolboth elaine and jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin arecall that the pms papers were using iu to iu of vitamin ai dont suggest that my students use these high doses if you wanted to fill the liver up fastas part of a clinical trial and were monitoring the serum retinol level then you would be okay but my knowledge of the vitamin a literature suggests to me that iu for patients with a demonstrated vitamin a deficitdark adapatation test or serum retinol will provide a good and steady improvementas long as zinc and vitamin c status are good without having to worry about toxicity if they want to get more agressive fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol but vitamin aretinol should never be given in high dose to women who could become pregnant since vitamin a shows teratogenicity towards the human fetus the dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is iu of retinol per day betacarotene will never have this effect on the human fetuscould just taking betacarotene instead of retinol supplements help yes but the effect will take a long time to develop my advise is to use retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to betacarotene to keep it full vitamin a is probably one nutrient that is better off left to prescription by doctors but when we have the mds in this newsgroup jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin a supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and gi distress i think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin a in the otc market but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general public about the dangers of vitamin a supplementationmarty bfrom donrmsrhpcom don montgomerysubject re feverfew for

there had to be a better way to treat human disease since he saw the curedrugs as being worse than the disease through his many years of study of the human body he developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to his students in the uss first osteopathic medical school we now have still used manipulation to treatand also diagnose human disease but he used diet to prevent human

cause cannot bedetermined the diagnosis of cph is made on the basis of liver biopsy itconsists of findings of portal inflammation an intact periportal limitingplate and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis but in contrastto chronic active hepatitis cah there is no periportal inflammation bridging necrosis or fibrosis cph has indeed an excellent prognosis if i had to choose between cah andcph there is no question i would also choose cph however as david pointedout the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would haveit the histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal with biopsies showingareas compatible with both cph and cah maybe it is a sampling problem maybeit is a continuum i dont knowdarn just when i think i understand something someone who knows thepathology has to burst my bubble wed better not start talking aboutglomerular diseases then ill really get depressedseriously though i wonder how someone with cph would end up getting abiopsy in the first place my understanding and feel free to correct meis that the enzymes are at worst mildly elevated with overall normalhepatic function i would think that the only clue might be a history ofprior hepb infection and a positive hepbsag or is it indeed on acontinuum with cah and the distinction merely one of pathology andprognosis but otherwise identical clinical features kenneth gilbert

few months ago and had some insomnia from it but noanxiety or jitters i probably could have lived with the insomnia if theprozac had done any good but it only provided a tiny benefit maybebecause the person who prescribed it didnt know much and gave up after amg dose didnt worknow im seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on zoloft another serotoninreuptake inhibitor like prozac one pillday mg seemed to help some now im trying mgday zoloft has fewer and milder side effects thanprozac i think my doctor said that only of the people taking zolofthave to discontinue it because of side effects the only problem imhaving is some minor gi distress but nothing too annoying hopefully thezoloft will work maybe your friend should try this one nextmy psychiatrists strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonindrugs usually prozac if that works great if it works but has too manyside effects try zoloft or maybe paxil if the serotonin drugs dont workat all try one of the tricyclics like

transaminases on routine screening tests the degree ofelevation in the serum transaminases can be trivial or as much as ten timesnormal other blood chemistries are usually normal as a rule patients with cph have no clinical signs of liver disease chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic atleast initially and thats why its important to tell them apart by means

these questionswhen kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or st grade infection incidence was much lower because exposure was lower some studies suggest that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and mortalitymumps measles etc how often do kids in their first second and third years fall sick how often do they get colds flus ear infections is there any data on home care vs day caredaycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care does being sick build immunity leading to less illness later does it make kids weaker leading to more illness later or does it not have any long term effectexposure to infectious organisms does build immunity but many viruses mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune responsenew antibody production in addition antibody levels tend to decline with time and reinnoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels highchronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long term effectsyes chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body health effects of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects of chronic antibiotic use a view that i do not support how does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than normal and what does one do about itchronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up in my opinion but most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many infectious diseases i do not share this view and there are some physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection frequency and severity exposure to an infectious agent does not have to result in a severe infection a strong immune response can minimize the length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms associated with the infection is there any way to build immunity and resistancethere are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong immune response to infectious agents they are protein vitamin c vitamin a iron and zinc the american diet is not low in protein so this is rarely a problem but vitamin a vitamin c iron and zinc are often low and this lack of an adequate poolnutrient reserve can impair the immune response iron is know to be low in most kidsas is vitamin a there are distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe infection serum ferritin for iron status dark adaptation for vitamin a status red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for vitamin c status i have attempted to work up posts on these five nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the others that i participate in i can email you what ive worked up so farbut my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the critical role that diet plays in the human immune response you may also be able to get help from a nutritionist anyone can call themselves a nutritionist so you have to be very carefull you want to find someonelike myself who has had some formal training and education in nutritionmany phd programs in the us now offer degrees in nutrition and thats what you need to look for some dieticians will also call themselves nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests they are very good for getting general dietary advice from however any data information or advice relating to this would be much
