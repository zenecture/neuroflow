Subject: New '94 Talon?????

In article:

Is there such a thing as the new '94 Eagle Talon? I heard from a freind that
the new '94 Talons have been released? Is this true and if so what are the
differences between the '93 and '94? Any opinions? I would appreciate any
replies and I would also prefer E-mail, thanks!
