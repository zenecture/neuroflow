Subject: Re: Auto air conditioning without Freon

We are working on gas-solid adsorption air-con system for auto applications.
In this kind of system, the energy for regenerating the adsorbent is from 
the exhaust gas.  Anyone interested in this mail email me or follow up this
thread, we may have a discussion on prospects of this technology.
