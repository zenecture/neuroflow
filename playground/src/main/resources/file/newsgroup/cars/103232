   I wouldn't want anyone to make kindling out of my front living-
   room wall and then drive their diesel powered M-60 tank into it,
   shooting super-hot soot all over my curtains and that freshly 
   made kindling.
   In other words, please don't FLAME me!

	  Yup, I'll have to answer for this one.
